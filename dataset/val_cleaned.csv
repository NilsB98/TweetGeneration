3,But Im just a simple sheep/ram
4,Sheep replicants
5,Sheeps thank you
6,Are you good with sheep?
7,Im an absolute unit too
8,"Yeah, gave everything I had to Tesla in Dec"
9,"Its not a big deal. Charge to % to % &amp; youll be fine. At % state of charge, regen braking doesnt work, because the battery is full, so car is less energy efficient."
10,Haha
11,Yes
12,Rockets are not yet safe enough to fly over land
13,"Engines seem ok, pending inspection"
14,"It can, but the attachment fixtures are different from standard F9 &amp; they werent ready in time"
15,Winter in snowfall is so beautiful
16,Im actually less crazy in person or am I?
17,I was always crazy on Twitter fyi
18,Yes
19,Haha true. I actually love horses.
20,Buying a car in that cant upgrade to full self-driving is like buying a horse instead of a car in
21,Love Just Water btw
22,"With steel membrane wings like a Dragon, we may be able to lower Starships orbital reentry temp to ~1000 degrees C, which would allow the whole surface to be uncooled bare metal"
23,Starship will land on a ring of fire
24,Yes
25,Winter is coming
26,Thinking about adding giant stainless steel dragon wings to Starship
27,"That tweet did take immense effort Fair point tho. Powerwall production is now ramping fast. Tesla was cell-starved last year, so we had to switch all lines to make packs for cars, which meant Powerwall production was living off scraps."
28,Deal
29,Please support my campaign to rebrand as emoji!
30,"At some point, and I should just a get a room"
31,Just use this handy guide
32,Yes
33,Good interview by
34,Truth
35,Exactly
36,How embarrassing. Will change.
37,We will. You read it right.
38,Haha true
39,Ive always thought that the fundamental good of Tesla should be measured by the number of years by which it accelerates the transition to sustainable transport &amp; energy
40,"Good point, small oil is a problem too"
41,"Im sorry, Fred, but WSJ has relentlessly attacked Tesla with bogus articles for over a decade. They cant *all* be chalked up to poor reporting. Where are the WSJ expos pieces on oil, coal &amp; gas? That industry is times bigger than Tesla. Perhaps theyre all angels"
42,"Yes, this was an utter boldface (literally) lie! Unbelievable that WSJ would write something so false."
43,"True, Bloomberg is almost as bad"
44,Holman Jenkins &amp; WSJ in general are sock puppets of big oil
45,Starship is kinda Gundam
46,"Very much so. There are B cars &amp; trucks on Earth. Even replacing % of that fleet would require making M vehicles per year. Tesla will make over k cars in next months, but thats a mere % of M or % of global vehicle fleet. Car industry slow -&gt; demand &gt;&gt; supply."
47,"Sentry Mode fundamentally empowers the individual car owner over entrenched interests, in this case a corrupt traffic judge. Even Tesla doesnt have access to the video unless sent to us by owner."
48,Mint berry crunch
49,poetic justice
50,Boring candy coming soon
51,"Mr Buffett, please stop destroying Dairy Queen. In the name of all that is holy, please stop."
52,"Wow, a lot of people dont know much about how manufacturing works! If you have peak capacity of X, actual average weekly output will necessarily be less than X. First -12 months, it will be much less than X. Impossible to predict exact production ramp S-curve."
53,"There is GWh/yr theoretical capacity, but actual max output is ~2/3. It was physically impossible to make more Model s in Q1 due to cell constraints."
54,Yes
55,"Yes, all cars with Autopilot or higher, so ~400,000 of Tesla cars built to date"
56,"Your interventions do train the NN, but we first verify that the training doesnt cause other issues, so expect step rather than continuous changes in capability"
57,Yes
58,"There will be that too, but economics will favor initial purchase"
59,"Hopefully have the order page live before then. If not, will push price change out a bit later."
60,Not good enough yet. Pushing release by a few weeks. Will be amazing.
61,Incorrect. Pana cell lines at Giga are only at ~24GWh/yr &amp; have been a constraint on Model output since July. No choice but to use other suppliers for Powerwall/Powerpack cells. Tesla wont spend money on more capacity until existing lines get closer to GWh theoretical.
62,Tesla will start FSD computer upgrade in a few months
63,Something like that
64,Starting May
65,Please note that the price of the Tesla Full Self-Driving option will increase substantially over time
66,Coming this year
67,Lease a Tesla online in a few mins &amp; have it delivered to your house (return within days for full refund)
68,Cryptocurrency is my safe word
69,Model drive unit &amp; body is designed like a commercial truck for a million mile life. Current battery modules should last k to k miles (1500 cycles). Replacing modules (not pack) will only cost $5k to $7k.
70,Cool
71,"On April , Investor Autonomy Day, Tesla will free investors from the tyranny of having to drive their own car"
72,Uh its a simulation hello
73,Da Vinci biography
74,Malala
75,That would be cool to do one day
76,Other automakers change prices constantly &amp; substantially by varying rebates &amp; discounts according to negotiating strength of buyer. Tesla is transparent &amp; consistent.
77,"So if we raise prices in the future, will you cut Tesla a check? Cant have it both ways."
78,Ahem RHD
79,LHD order page should be live within a few weeks. Deliveries start hopefully June/July.
80,Coming this year
81,Good point
82,Leasing now available for Model
83,Samwise
84,Am basically doing continuous AMA on Twitter!
85,"This is true. They each have avionics, several nitrogen thrusters &amp; steerable parachutes."
86,SpaceX team
87,Made on Earth by humans
88,Yes
89,"Recovered from water, but undamaged"
90,Both fairing halves recovered. Will be flown on Starlink mission later this year.
91,Thanks on behalf of team! We !
92,Liquid oxygen
93,The Falcons have landed
94,. team would be so honored to fly this for !
95,Haha exactly
96,Upper atmospheric wind shear is very high. Will have to postpone launch unless weather improves soon.
97,Vengeance
98,Haha sure sounds like it
99,Probably something notable to announce in a few months
100,"I hope a cybernetic interface is ready in time. Symbiosis, irrelevance (hopefully blissful) or doom seem to be the three most likely paths."
101,Actually true
102,Found a pic
103,"First flight for Falcon Heavy Block means there is some risk of failure between % to % imo. Many good design improvements from Falcon Heavy demo, but the changes are unproven."
104,I first read this as making wind with
105,Norway has already proven it could be done last month. No question Australia could do this in far fewer than years.
106,. copy
107,"No, its better"
108,"Building primary structure completion seems on track for May, but then it will take several months to install &amp; activate factory equipment"
109,Love Brunel. Great first name too.
110,Yes
111,Mobile can do it no problem
112,"Doesnt matter yet whether you have Tesla FSD computer or Tesla Nvidia-based computer. When it does matter later this year, Tesla will switch the computers for you."
113,What city?
114,"Two, independent system-on-chip architecture, with each SoC having two NN accelerators that can perform simultaneous health-check calculations to protect against a soft error"
115,Yes. Working through regulatory approvals.
116,The Tesla Full Self-Driving Computer now in production is at about % compute load for these tasks or % with full fail-over redundancy
117,Time flies
118,Any user input counts
119,Car looks for a slightly turning force on wheel (direction is irrelevant) to confirm that driver hands are on steering wheel before initiating lane change. Just a precautionary measure until we have a few billion miles/km of real-world lane changes with reliability &gt;&gt; human.
120,It will enable video when parked &amp; connected to WiFi. All Tesla Superchargers will have free WiFi over time.
121,Youre welcome. Thanks for your great photos!
122,"Yeah, Id love to do that"
123,Starhopper
124,Good idea
125,Definitely
126,Already fixed
127,To make core AP more affordable
128,That would be cool. Color variation causes havoc though.
129,"Team is working on international versions super hard btw. Unfortunately, regulators around the world have different rules &amp; processes, so just takes time."
130,Tesla Enhanced Summon coming out in US next week for anyone with Enhanced Autopilot or Full Self-Driving option
131,Precisely
132,Almost done
133,Are you on Mad Max Mode? This may be too meek for places like the LA Freeway
134,Radar
135,Sure
136,Exactly
137,"Base AP will have same NN, so core functionality also improves"
138,Many different regulatory authorities. Just takes time.
139,Latest Autopilot update is epic. Rolling out to all US owners with Enhanced Autopilot or Full Self-Driving option. International coming soon.
140,Starhopper just lifted off &amp; hit tether limits!
141,Max thrust of tons will be almost % higher than Falcon Heavy demo mission last year
142,"Static fire data looks good so far. This is first launch of Falcon Heavy Block , so were being extra cautious. Launch date might move."
143,Exactly
144,"drivers in this dataset use Autopilot for % of their driven miles, and yet appear to maintain a relatively high degree of functional vigilance."
145,Hi Nina! So how many would it take? Just between us.
146,Stay positive
147,Good point
148,How much is it?
149,"I think Ive paid for a subscription at least three times, but your paywall keeps forgetting this"
150,"Please fix your paywall. Your content is great, but your paywall is not."
151,Yes
152,"Yes, instead of someone needing to drive their car personally, they can manage a fleet of self-driving cars"
153,Thats exactly the idea. Whats not well understood is that Tesla cars being made *today* will be able to do that for you. Just a matter of finishing the software &amp; going through regulatory approval. Will be explained in depth via live webcast on April .
154,Thanks
155,Great work with Stripe btw. Much needed.
156,Im told its looking positive &amp; we will be allowed to continue servicing our cars in Texas
157,Sentry Mode is barely at V1.0. Will improve a lot in coming months.
158,Impressive analysis
159,"Only external cameras are being used right now, so internal is not enabled. When it is enabled, well add a setting to disable internal camera."
160,"Also, it can be used to supplement cameras on outside of vehicle, as it can see through nd side windows &amp; rear window."
161,"Its there for when we start competing with Uber/Lyft &amp; people allow their car to earn money for them as part of the Tesla shared autonomy fleet. In case someone messes up your car, you can check the video."
162,Will take care of it
163,Improvements coming soon
164,"Yes, needs to drive best clear path. Lane lines are just one input."
165,Great name
166,Neural net is upgraded too in this release. Its not just a settings change.
167,"Totally agree. Tesla phone app should have all controls that car center screen has, so your phone can serve as a complete backup."
168,Starhopper completed tethered hop. All systems green.
169,Glad you like it! Sorry about the trouble earlier. Helpful feedback for improving the car!
170,This is way more awesome than it might sound
171,Night mode default brightness is actually too high imo. Should be lower &amp; allow below current % level. Making that adjustment too.
172,Agreed
173,Night mode with % brightness is actually too dark during the day. This is ultimately our fault. We will update our software so that % brightness is always usable relative to ambient conditions.
174,Change your screen preference from night mode to auto
175,Fur-curious
176,These rumors are untrue!
177,"Responsible for more deaths than any other chemical! Weirdly, dihydrogen dixoxide, with only one extra oxygen, is not good to drink, but great for changing hair color."
178,Axel F
179,"Obv just someone in a suit. Also, very sus that a is reporting on this."
180,Dogecoin value may vary
181,Dogecoin rulz
182,Uh oh
183,Dogecoin might be my fav cryptocurrency. Its pretty cool.
184,Yup
185,Some challenges with ice formation in the cryogenic propellant prevalves. Hopefully overcome soon.
186,What could possibly go wrong?
187,No
188,Youre so right. Working on it!
189,That car seemed so advanced when I watched that show as a kid! Knight Industries Two Thousand
190,And even tinier ones for tardigrades
191,Yes
192,"Going forward, all Tesla stores will be tiny &amp; have tiny cars"
193,"Meant to say young, but spelled it wrong"
194,Ironic stan
195,"If can do this, what cant they do!?"
196,"Solid work by Keen, as usual"
197,Norway
198,Yes
199,Yes
200,Seems fair
201,"Some people use their hair to express themselves, I use Twitter"
202,Making The Onion articles real
203,Duck emoji FTW
204,Final edit was on Ableton
205,"Surprisingly difficult to address false positives with rain. System would go nuts trying to wipe away non-existent rain, which was obv ineffective."
206,Jung
207,Weve been so mired in production &amp; logistics for past months. Really looking fwd to getting Semi into production.
208,Tesla Semi delivering Tesla cars
209,Pre-Happy birthday!
210,"Amazing work by Tesla Delivery teams, especially in Europe &amp; China! Most insane logistics challenge Ive ever seen. Thanks also to many country &amp; city officials for your help this weekend! Super appreciated."
211,Coming soon!
212,No
213,Wow
214,This might be my finest work
215,Duck emoji defeats Emo G Records. Crushing victory.
216,Im disappointed that my record label failed
217,Emo G Records
218,Instagram comments are coding in emojis
219,Also true
220,True
221,The quality of emojis varies wildly
222,Lame
223,C++ syntax sucks
224,"Assert (Money == Series of heterogeneous databases insecurely connected with high latency. Primary purpose == Information system for allocation of human time. As automation++, value of money--);"
225,Even connectivity at my house in Silicon Valley sucks!
226,Like the movie Us. Scary but also empathetic.
227,"No, but for sure the other way around!"
228,"Also the intense low frequency vibrations that you cant hear, but you can feel in your chest"
229,"Were going to try. Side boosters come back to Cape, center core lands on droneship. Latter will be coming in v hot &amp; fast, so dicey."
230,"Annoying that perpetuates myth that Delta IV Heavy or Atlas V can do some orbits that Falcon Heavy cant. This is absolutely false. FH would have to go full expendable for GEO direct, but thats very rare."
231,"Yeah, Falcon Heavy Block has way more performance than last years vehicle. Lot of room to increase side booster load transfer &amp; max Q without changing any parts. FH Block can launch more payload to any orbit than any vehicle currently flying."
232,"Probably no fairing either &amp; just Raptor Vacuum engines. Mass ratio of ~30 (1200 tons full, tons empty) with Isp of . Then drop a few dozen modified Starlink satellites from empty engine bays with ~1600 Isp, MR . Spread out, see whats there. Not impossible."
233,"Retrofits will start when our software is able to take meaningful advantage of the Tesla FSD computer, which is an order of magnitude more capable. For now, its slightly disadvantageous to have Tesla FSD computer, as our software is more refined for HW2."
234,Anyone who bought FSD will get it
235,"Anyone who purchased full self-driving will get FSD computer upgrade for free. This is the only change between Autopilot HW2.5 &amp; HW3. Going forward HW3 will just be called FSD Computer, which is accurate. No change to vehicle sensors or wire harness needed. This is v important."
236,Yes. Sensitive propulsion &amp; avionics remained dry. Great work by SpaceX Dragon engineering team. Major improvement over Dragon .
237,"Massive delta velocity slam from highly elliptical Earth orbit using a fully retanked, but lightened up Starship with no heat shield or fins/legs. Best choice for the impatient. Ion engines are too slow."
238,"We should send probes to outer solar system &amp; get high res, true color images of these strange things. Maybe theres an alien artifact out there"
239,Super cool!
240,Good point
241,"Tax authorities tend to interpret things in their favor, but it sure sounds like you could be right! Will investigate."
242,"Rare use case, but it is possible. There are complications with this. Eary prototype Roadsters had this ability."
243,Exactly
244,Super proud of Tesla Autopilot team!
245,"No, it is one week either way."
246,"I think so. For sure worth giving it our best shot! Would be great to have a competitive, commercial program to build a moon base that is outcome-oriented (not cost-plus), so you only get paid for safe delivery of cargo."
247,It would be so inspiring for humanity to see humanity return to the moon!
248,lbs!? How puny. Do you construct childrens toys?
249,Thats exactly it. Youre no longer mentally fatigued after a long drive. Makes a major difference to your happiness level commuting home from work after a long day.
250,Good point
251,Hard to appreciate how much Tesla Autopilot improves enjoyment of driving until you try it
252,"Yes, otherwise propellant usage for an atmospheric entry would be very high and/or center of mass would need to be very tightly constrained. Yes, but were going to skip that at first to avoid fragging launch pads."
253,Glad you like it! Navigate on Autopilot hopefully approved for Europe soon.
254,Thank you!
255,Will do
256,"Ford has CEOs in years &amp; nobody blinks, but Tesla loses intern &amp; its front page news. I tell ya (shakes fist at sky)"
257,"Its possible to make a self-sustaining city on Mars by , if we start in years &amp; take orbital synchronizations"
258,Youre most welcome! Glad to be helpful.
259,Only when Y is in production
260,"Every car company is constantly changing prices, but nobody cares"
261,"Import tariffs, VAT &amp; transport costs"
262,"To be clear, this doesnt affect Tesla website order prices. Existing inventory prices are currently slightly lower than on website. This will bring them in line."
263,"To be precise, midnight on April , so effective April"
264,Please note prices on all Tesla inventory cars worldwide rise by ~3% on April
265,About to be upgraded to Chromium
266,Reset
267,Sentry Mode options will be: Always Exclude Home Exclude Work Exclude saved locations Ask Off
268,"If someone has already won a Roadster from a prior program, theyre only eligible to win the signed Performance Y"
269,Sounds like a good idea
270,How to win the boss fight in Sekiro
271,"No, its cumulative, but once you win one of the prizes, referral count resets to zero &amp; you cant win that prize again. Intent over time is to enable those without a massive social media presence to win."
272,WW
273,"Agreed, you can only win each prize once"
274,Youre welcome!
275,New Tesla referral program just released
276,Why uh yes we comprehensive statistics that go deep &amp; wide
277,Me too! He was so great. Loved Colbert Report too.
278,Jim Cramer explains short-seller market manipulation
279,Jim cant take the heat
280,"Jim, no response?"
281,Exactly
282,"Best to get a Tesla Powerwall, so you can power your house &amp; also drive"
283,Probably start Australia builds in late May or June &amp; start arriving in winter
284,Coming soon
285,"Yes, full duration"
286,White-hot parts reached orbital entry temp of around Kelvin
287,"Falcon rocket booster is aluminum-lithium &amp; carbon fiber, which have low max temperature allowables. Super Heavy booster is stainless steel. Since it only goes to around Mach or , moreover at high altitude, it needs no heat shield, not even paint."
288,Transpiration cooling will be added wherever we see erosion of the shield. Starship needs to be ready to fly again immediately after landing. Zero refurbishment.
289,No straight path for hot gas to accelerate through the gaps
290,Testing Starship heatshield hex tiles
291,"Hexagonal tiles on most of windward side, no shield needed on leeward side, transpiration cooling on hotspots"
292,Only some of the hottest sections
293,Full size
294,We decided to skip building a new nosecone for Hopper. Dont need it. What you see being built is the orbital Starship vehicle.
295,"You can deep throttle on single shaft system by choking flow of fuel or oxygen between pump &amp; combustion chamber. Problem is more with the tiny rocket engine that powers the pump, called a gas generator. That has to throttle *way* deeper than the main chamber."
296,"Working on regulatory approval for both Boca Chica, Texas, and Cape Kennedy, Florida. Will also be building Starship &amp; Super Heavy simultaneously in both locations."
297,Agreed
298,"Raptor is *very* complex, even for a staged combustion engine. Were simplifying as much as possible with each iteration. Throttling down to ~50% is hard, but manageable. Going to % would be extremely tough, but hopefully not needed."
299,"Started rolling it out a few days ago. Always starts slow, find rare corner case issues, fix them, continue rollout"
300,"Hopefully. Always many issues integrating engine &amp; stage. First hops will lift off, but only barely."
301,First (really short) hops with one engine. Suborbital flights with three.
302,Goes against interests of all Texans
303,"Wow, this is crazy"
304,"If someone really wants to return the car in good faith on day , thats fine"
305,"To be clear, orders are fully refundable, even after youve had your Tesla for a week"
306,Reminder to buy our S3XY cars before midnight on Monday! Prices rise slightly worldwide on Tuesday. You can order online at .
307,Yes!
308,"Definitely down the road, once construction &amp; upgrades arent so crazy"
309,"This causes some media confusion, as batch builds &amp; ship arrival times can make our sales seem incredible one month &amp; terrible following month, but consumer tastes dont actually vary so much. Massive month over month changes are usually because of production/shipping schedules."
310,"Not exactly same time, as countries have different regulations &amp; we try to build in batches to simplify production"
311,"Might arrive by June, but def before end of summer"
312,"Model partial permanent magnet induction motor, especially with silicon carbide inverter, is so efficient that it outdoes two induction motors. If we could decouple forward induction motor to avoid spin losses, then range of dual might be higher, but thats a lot of complexity."
313,"Exactly! In fact, better to have RWD with winter tires than AWD with summer tires. We appreciate the extra expenditure if people do buy AWD, but it isnt critical for snowy regions."
314,"Still get this question a lot, even though Norway has highest Tesla cars per person on (super appreciated!). Also, AWD is nice to have, but def not required for snow/ice."
315,"About a minute in, we flashed a teaser pic of Tesla cyberpunk truck"
316,End Titles from Blade Runner played after Model Y webcast cut
317,Designed to feel much bigger on inside than it looks on outside. An incredibly important principle.
318,"There was something, but no one caught it"
319,It also feels way bigger on the inside than it appears on the outside
320,"Would love to be there this year. If not, definitely next! India"
321,Yeah
322,Exactly!
323,London to Beijing Supercharger route
324,Worth watching Revenge of the Electric Car. Covers rebirth of electric cars in general. Has footage before &amp; after we started production of our first car.
325,The hardest joke ever
326,With pie
327,"Long-term, its about coupling the collective will of humanity to AI. Short-term, its about improving the lives of those with brain or spine problems."
328,"Next software update will increase storm watch sensitivity. Youre right, its currently too low."
329,Checking into this
330,S3XY
331,OTA
332,Plug in a USB drive to record video
333,"Comes with , which finishes validation this week"
334,Looking forward to building a Boring Company tunnel in Vegas. Assuming to be operational by end of year!
335,Yes
336,Our list prices are our actual prices. Software (and automotive) vary prices frequently by changing the discount or rebate.
337,"Sure, that would be great"
338,Sure
339,Correct
340,Thats the plan
341,Of course
342,"In retrospect, lower price shouldnt have been offered. Was done so because some simply couldnt afford it. Prices revert to normal on Monday."
343,"However, this obviously cannot be discussed with entire global stores team beforehand or news would leak"
344,"We are still closing stores, just not as many as before. This basically splits the difference about half as many stores closed, but then can afford only about half the price reduction. Was discussed with exec team &amp; board."
345,"When prices go down, those who already bought want the lower price, but, if prices go up, those who already bought dont want to write Tesla a check. So it goes."
346,Yes
347,Those prices will revert to normal on Monday too
348,Applies worldwide
349,Yes
350,"Tesla car prices go up ~3% next week, except for $35k Model . Order online at before then for current prices."
351,Couldnt resolve all the rights issues. Will add another racing game soon.
352,Ok
353,"Yeah, it might break"
354,Software release later this week should make it better
355,True (sigh)
356,True
357,"Probably right. Starship rate of progress far exceeds Falcon &amp; Dragon, although theyre critical to getting there. dInnovation/dt is what matters long-term."
358,"For cargo missions, propulsive land landing should be no problem. Doesnt have same safety criticality as crew."
359,Pretty much any moon or planet that has a solid or liquid surface
360,"Most likely, but this is contingent upon NASA review &amp; approval"
361,"Best to use a giant brake pad, aka heat shield"
362,No
363,"Dragon was designed to land using thrusters, with parachutes as backup. Switched to chutes as primary, due to difficulty of proving safety, but Dragon can still do it."
364,km/h
365,Raptor on way to Hopper. Will be mounted to vehicle next week.
366,NK-33 &amp; RD /180 are exceptional
367,Thank you on behalf of SpaceX! We have always admired your rocket/spacecraft technology.
368,Thank you on behalf of the people of SpaceX!
369,"All good, system maintained room temperature within spacecraft"
370,"Phenolic impregnated carbon ablator, version"
371,Atmospheric entry at mph is like a meteor &amp; will vaporize steel. Burn marks below are on cold side. Main heatshield on bottom.
372,"Yes, invitations go out tomorrow"
373,Getting rid of peak power splitting across two bays &amp; updated software with battery warmup results in &gt;2X improvement in fleet charge time
374,"We will spend or months with public beta of V3 in North America, make sure there are no corner case issues &amp; then begin buildout worldwide."
375,"Those improvements are independent of Supercharger V3 power increase from kW to +kW. All factors considered, charge time will drop by factor of best case &amp; more than for whole Tesla fleet. Effectively, this more than doubles total WW Supercharger system throughput."
376,"Latest software improves Tesla Supercharger times by up to % for all Tesla S/X/3 worldwide, incl original Model S. Not splitting power across Supercharger stalls helps all cars up to %."
377,So true
378,Extremely important merch
379,"Net power to warm pack is especially low when motors are running, as coolant loop routes motor heat to the pack when outside is cold (&amp; rejects motor heat to air when outside is warm)"
380,"Yes, but an engine shouldnt count until it flies"
381,Ukraine did play a major role
382,Very little power &amp; only right before you get to the Supercharger. You wont notice it in range.
383,"If you navigate to Supercharger, car will warm up battery en route, so you start immediately at max power"
384,Russia has excellent rocket engineering &amp; best engine currently flying. Reusable version of their new Angara rocket would be great.
385,"Thanks, that sounds great!"
386,Youre most welcome. Very proud of Tesla team. Super tough years!
387,"Oh stop, youll make me blush"
388,Ok
389,"Yeah, I lift a little"
390,Tesla comms is fixing. That was a mistake.
391,So cute!
392,Buddy is like an Earth Pokmon
393,"Gap in understanding is that $35k Model production *starts* this month, but will not reach volume production until mid year. Extremely difficult to predict middle part of manufacturing S-curve."
394,Yes
395,"No, just literally having toast &amp; jam while playing Jamming"
396,Having toast &amp; jam in kitchen while playing Jamming by Bob Marley
397,"Yes. Personally, Im most excited by the Tesla Truck. Maybe it will be too futuristic for most people, but I love it."
398,"Yes, anyone will be able to take videos"
399,I believe so
400,"No, that unveil is later this year"
401,Slightly higher drag * slightly higher frontal area affects air friction &amp; mass affects rolling resistance &amp; hill climb. Physics is the law.
402,Normal
403,Yes
404,"Detailed specs &amp; pricing will be provided, as well as test rides in Y"
405,"Model Y, being an SUV, is about % bigger than Model , so will cost about % more &amp; have slightly less range for same battery"
406,Model Y unveil event on March at LA Design Studio
407,First public Tesla V3.0 Supercharger Station goes live Wed pm
408,"SpaceX team in Hawthorne control, Dragon docked to Station above"
409,SpaceX Crew Dragon has docked with International
410,"Yes, she would be able to breathe"
411,Proximity docking sequence underway. Dragon shadow visible on on solar arrays.
412,One day we will be there to see for ourselves
413,F
414,Something like this could work
415,Everyone knows Earth is hollow
416,I am not a dog. Heres a pic of me:
417,Model S will be raised to mph too
418,Thank you. May you have good luck and godspeed with your spacecraft!
419,"Thank you on behalf of SpaceX. Also, thank you to , without whom this would not be possible."
420,Power will increase on all cars. Top speed on P increases to mph. Range on RWD increases to miles.
421,"Yes, new cars and existing fleet"
422,Firmware update coming later this month will increase power by ~5% &amp; top speed by km/h or mph
423,Spoiler alert: not Porsche
424,Thank you on behalf of the many people of SpaceX
425,Lightning bolt right before launch
426,Earth floats gently in zero gravity
427,SpaceX Crew Dragon recap
428,Need to get back to SpaceX launch control. Sorry this solution isnt perfect.
429,"Were trying to make EVs &amp; autonomy more affordable over time. This is the right thing to do. However, we cannot then also retroactively make earlier buyers whole without killing the company."
430,Will take a few days for system update
431,"Yeah, we need a few days to update the system. If anyone already paid $3k, they should get $1k back."
432,"Its not exactly symmetric, but it will come with HW3 upgrade long-term"
433,"If you bought enhanced autopilot, FSD upgrade costs $2k instead of $5k"
434,"If you bought a Tesla before yesterdays price reduction, you can have Autopilot or full self-driving at half normal cost (up to $6k less)"
435,He is the sensor!
436,"Nope, hes going to float around in zero gravity"
437,Super high tech zero-g indicator added just before launch!
438,Happy birthday!
439,"Yeah, just use a dryer outlet. High power, easy to install &amp; low cost."
440,Explanation from Tesla later today
441,Yes
442,Haha
443,Ripley
444,"Base Model available in Europe in ~6 months, Asia to months. Latter contingent on Shanghai Gigafactory. Country-specific taxes &amp; import duties mean price may be % or more above US number."
445,Exactly
446,No reductions from here
447,For sure. It fundamentally improves quality of life.
448,Best choice for most people is standard range plus with Autopilot
449,Exact Tesla Model in my profile pic costs $35k before incentives &amp; takes minute to buy online at
450,I think we should do something here. Will talk with team &amp; send out a note in next few days.
451,Should be ~5% peak power increase with March software release
452,"Scheduled for March release, along with many other improvements"
453,"Everyone who bought Enhanced Autopilot will get Navigate on Autopilot on highways, advanced summon &amp; autopark"
454,I was being too obvious
455,Make the Mars Technocracy real
456,Yay!
457,ET phone home. No answer
458,Some Tesla news
459,Haha
460,Yes
461,Stop censoring science!
462,Because it costs $2500 to transport to east coast &amp; everyone pays same
463,California
464,Thursday pm
465,"Rest of SpaceX propulsion still very active, so only ~50 full-time equivalent people right now. That will grow a lot as we enter production. Its X harder (at least) to design engine production system than engine. In automotive, X harder."
466,"Maybe active in a month or so. Focus right now is getting to high speed, tight follow distance in test tunnel."
467,"Yes, exciting potential"
468,Exactly
469,"Printers are too small. Also, high pressure, high efficiency engines need copper cooling channels with an inco/steel jacket. Cant print yet."
470,Exactly. This has now happened several times. Something is broken with SEC oversight.
471,"Tom did an awesome job leading Merlin, Kestrel, Draco &amp; other engine developments from start through that were critical to SpaceXs success. Great respect &amp; appreciation!"
472,"Thank you Evelyn, I loved it"
473,"Indeed. I have great respect for judges. Its not perfect, but, in general, we should be very glad of the US justice system."
474,"SEC forgot to read Tesla earnings transcript, which clearly states k to k. How embarrassing"
475,Oh hi lol
476,"Fate *loves* irony. Frankly, too much."
477,Meetings are a valuable use of time!
478,Theres a in my
479,Respawn++
480,Great meme review hosted by Will Smith
481,Haha true
482,Its designed to be way better. Well see what reality has to say about that.
483,"Yes, lot of risk"
484,"Guys, I have feelings"
485,Focusing on Starship instead
486,Deorbits &amp; burns up over the Pacific
487,"Upper stage is flight, except mass sim in place of Merlin. It will get fragged for sure by aero loads &amp; Dragon abort thrusters."
488,"Including Heavy, which is cores, around or so"
489,"Depends on when Crew Dragon comes back. Thats scheduled for launch next Saturday, but lot of new hardware, so time error bars are big."
490,"High probability of this particular rocket getting destroyed by Dragon supersonic abort test. Otherwise, at least or missions for Falcon . Starship will take over before the F9 fleet reaches end of life."
491,Crew Dragon high altitude abort test
492,Yes
493,Highest reentry heating to date. Burning metal sparks from base heat shield visible in landing video. Fourth relight scheduled for April.
494,Always liked Kestrel. It was the Robin Hood of engines.
495,"Advanced, reusable rockets are all we need to become a multiplanet civilization. Once we have a city on Mars, interplanetary travel will create a forcing function for vast improvements in spaceflight."
496,SN2 has changes that should help
497,To the first part. I doubt wed create a Dyson ring or sphere.
498,Yes
499,"Merlins. The max chamber pressure run damaged Raptor SN (as expected). A lot of the parts are fine for reuse, but next tests will be with SN , which is almost done."
500,"Anti-matter production would require vast amounts of energy. No need though. We have a super reliable, massive, free fusion reactor called the sun."
501,"Exactly. Super money move is anti-matter drive, especially if you solve capturing antiprotons in deep space."
502,You can see the streaks on the vacuum Merlin nozzle in flight videos
503,Pinter injector tends to have hot &amp; cold streaks. Hot streaks burn a rut at the throat that accelerates erosion.
504,"Essentially, yes. Great engineering talent, but should focus on reusable rockets for purpose of a permanent human base on the moon and self-sustaining city on Mars."
505,"We are constrained by the accredited investor rule, but will think about how this could be done"
506,"Yeah, that was a bit embarrassing High engine chamber pressure and ablative dont get along. Ok for low pressure, expendable upper stage."
507,"Thats true Merlin A was terrible. C was ok, D good, but block Merlin (should probably be called E) is something special. Took about years to get there."
508,"Actually, they received (and still receive) almost a billion dollars a year for launch capability. Even if they do zero launches, US govt still gives them that."
509,Dont know
510,"SpaceX commercial launch market share went from % in to % in . Despite massive subsidies to Boeing/Lockeed, they have never won a fair competition against SpaceX for several years."
511,"Exactly. Thats the critical point for Starship/BFR: more payload than the biggest rocket ever made, but for less money per launch than the smallest (orbital) rocket. Without something that lowers orbital flight cost by X, humanity will never be a multiplanet species."
512,"SpaceX Merlin architecture is simpler than staged combustion (eg SSME or RD), but it has world record for thrust/weight &amp; thrust/cost engine. Raptor has better Isp, but Im worried it may fall short on those two critical metrics."
513,So true John Clarke
514,"Not true. Limiting factor in any staged combustion rocket engine, liquid/gas or gas/gas, is pressure &amp; temperature in oxygen preburner"
515,Whoever owns the early BTC deserves a Nobel prize in delayed gratification
516,"That said, I still only own BTC, which a friend sent me several years ago. Dont have any crypto holdings."
517,"I have been chief engineer/designer at SpaceX from day . Had I been better, our first launches might have succeeded, but I learned from those mistakes."
518,"Meant to say annualized production rate at end of probably around k, ie k cars/week. Deliveries for year still estimated to be about k."
519,Wont be long before they do
520,"Tesla made cars in , but will make around k in"
521,Tesla cars loading in SF for Europe
522,The gritty truth
523,Did meme review last night with Justin Roiland from
524,Agreed. Also needs option for automatically on all locations or if unknown location.
525,Pics are so clear in space!
526,That last bit gives a good sense of what orbit is like
527,"Also, Tesla was competing for some of same people as OpenAI &amp; I didnt agree with some of what OpenAI team wanted to do. Add that all up &amp; it was just better to part ways on good terms."
528,I had to focus on solving a painfully large number of engineering &amp; manufacturing problems at Tesla (especially) &amp; SpaceX
529,"To clarify, Ive not been involved closely with OpenAI for over a year &amp; dont have mgmt or board oversight"
530,SpaceX foundry casting Raptor engine manifold out of Inconel
531,It will soon
532,"Yes, Autopilot max speed is mph above speed limit off highway or mph on highway"
533,Of course I still love you
534,"This is in addition to existing Cabin Overheat Protection, which come on automatically at high temps to ensure any babies or pets in the car are safe"
535,Yes
536,"It will start out slow to make sure there are no corner case issues and then, if that looks good, speed up next week. We def need to add a Request Latest Update feature!"
537,Updating
538,"Wow,"
539,CNBC - Tesla Model ranked most satisfying car
540,"True, that headline is not exactly going to win a Pulitzer for originality"
541,"Probably a month or two. Sentry mode became top priority, so pushed that out a bit."
542,"Some sites maintained an almost daily Tesla deathwatch years ago, reporting with an awful delight. days later"
543,Tesla Model X first SUV to receive a perfect crash test rating via
544,Bet the other carmakers didnt see that one coming haha
545,"Yeah, but simpler. Needed for landing burn or engines will suck in a bubble."
546,"Starship &amp; Super Heavy will press tanks autogenously even in version . Very important, as helium costs more than oxygen on Falcon, even though liquid oxygen is /3 vehicle mass &amp; helium weighs basically nothing."
547,"Luke, I am your farter."
548,"Thanks Jack, Twitter rocks!"
549,To air is human
550,Agreed
551,Sorry Had a vital mission in Norway Now I am back
552,True
553,"Moon first, Mars as soon as the planets align"
554,On my bedside table
555,A biography on Korolev has center place in my study
556,"Just planning on keeping the public informed about progress &amp; setbacks. Will be some RUDs along the way, but excitement is guaranteed!"
557,The goodwill of the public is critical to Starships success
558,At least X cheaper
559,"Very dependent on volume, but Im confident moving to Mars (return ticket is free) will one day cost less than $500k &amp; maybe even below $100k. Low enough that most people in advanced economies could sell their home on Earth &amp; move to Mars if they want."
560,Yes
561,"This will sound implausible, but I think theres a path to build Starship / Super Heavy for less than Falcon"
562,Close
563,"But not an extendable nozzle though, as that just saves length. Nozzle diameter is limited by body diameter."
564,Much above bar main chamber pressure means extreme oxygen preburner pressure of to + bar. Definitely pushing the limit of known physics.
565,"Propellant was not deep cryo. CH4 &amp; O2 were just barely below liquid temp at bar. In theory, Raptor should do ~300 bar at deep cryo, provided everything holds together, which is far from certain. However, only bar is needed for nominal operation of Starship/Super Heavy."
566,"Yes, aiming for sec Isp with vac nozzle. Maybe if we get lucky."
567,I think where we lit main chamber &amp; several with only preburners
568,About secs
569,Definitely! Its amazing that the RD-170 &amp; RD-180 engines held the record for so many decades. Excellent engineering.
570,"Raptor reached bar today, exceeding prior record held by the awesome Russian RD-180. Great work by engine/test team!"
571,I was simply too sexy for it
572,Maybe tomorrow
573,"Just left Zeebrugge, now Tilburg, then Tesla HQ in Amsterdam &amp; Oslo tonight to review service in Norway. Exciting to see thousands of Model s on their way to owners in Europe!"
574,Hope they dont find this pic!
575,thank goodness its not November
576,a
577,I want you too baby
578,Joe Rogan describes Tesla for mins &amp; secs
579,"Booster center of mass is much lower &amp; more consistent (no payload mass to consider), so still biases towards engine first entry"
580,"Technically, the steel is radiatively cooled (not uncooled). T^4 is one of the most interesting things about reality!"
581,"Rocket booster temperatures wont go much above Kelvin on hottest parts of main body &amp; maybe around K on base, which uncooled steel can handle. Starship is around K for a Mach entry, so needs shielding of some kind."
582,Prob wise for version to have legs or we will frag a lot of launch pads
583,"Welded, internal, longitudinal hat stringers. To the degree it may need hoop stiffness (prob not), combine with slosh baffles."
584,"The Super Heavy booster is only needed on Earth, so think of this as just Starship &amp; sometimes it needs a boost, hence Super Heavy"
585,SpaceX Engineering
586,Telekinesis
587,Vaporized some copper
588,Sentry Mode (and Dog Mode) roll out next week
589,"Design requires at least metric tons of force. Engine reached mT &amp; bar chamber pressure with warm propellant, which means % to % more with deep cryo."
590,Raptor just achieved power level needed for Starship &amp; Super Heavy
591,"Sorry, many unexpected challenges with cars coming through Zeebrugge first time. Cars will start moving out in volume tomorrow."
592,Were doing everything we can to get there. Its a super hard grind.
593,"Exactly. Both prices are shown right next to each other &amp; lower price is *actually* the real apples to apples cost vs a fuel car. In fact, for many states in the US, its way better."
594,VAT of ~20% &amp; import duties of ~10% usually result in a % higher cost in Europe
595,Mach Diamonds
596,Glad you like it
597,Spark plugs ignite dual blow torches that ignite preburners &amp; main chamber
598,"Gaseous CH4/O2 &amp; heavy duty spark plugs. Basically, a of insane power"
599,"Will do, although SpaceX reddit is very well-informed. Really impressive analysis by some commenters."
600,Engine use methox torch igniters. Green tinge is either camera saturation or a tiny bit of copper from the chamber.
601,First firing of Starship Raptor flight engine! So proud of great work by team!!
602,We will when it rolls out
603,Yes
604,At Texas with engineering team getting ready to fire new Raptor rocket engine
605,soon
606,Only a matter of time
607,That might be the ultimate superpower
608,How Model performs on a long road trip
609,"Im openly moderate. There, I said it."
610,Haha how is this even real?
611,"No, payload will actually increase"
612,Exactly
613,I do like nonsense memes. Its true.
614,Yes
615,Next few days
616,looks like sentient choc ice cream
617,Just bought oh yeah
618,Whoa cool
619,No plans to do so. Would recommend Model S.
620,logarithms
621,Dammit!
622,"Well tweak the alloy over time, so it wont exactly be , but close"
623,"Well, my past mistakes do seem extremely dumb, especially the ones where I mistakenly thought I was smart"
624,"Rocket mass ratio is about the same for aluminum-lithium vs stainless full hard at cryo, but latter costs way less, is tougher &amp; doesnt even need paint!"
625,Still up to . Will probably fly with fewer initially in case it blows up.
626,Mostly true
627,"Cold gas thrusters only. Will use body flaps &amp; main engines for landing orientation, so wont need high thrust reaction control. Simplifies things considerably."
628,Yes
629,Initially making one metric ton thrust engine common across ship &amp; booster to reach the moon as fast as possible. Next versions will split to vacuum-optimized (380+ sec Isp) &amp; sea-level thrust optimized (~250 ton).
630,Preparing to fire the Starship Raptor engine at Texas
631,Yes. Its very rare to find all three.
632,"To be clear, Im confident that a stainless steel ship will be lighter than advanced aluminum or carbon fiber, because of strength to weight vs temperature &amp; reduced need for heat shielding"
633,"Will probably make booster legs/flaps same as ship, instead of like F9"
634,"Yes, ship needs pitch/roll/yaw control across wide Mach regime &amp; angle of attack"
635,Absolutely. Youve touched on a very important point. The ship must be easy to repair on the moon and Mars.
636,And Tesla Gigafactory is steadily becoming self-powered by solar
637,"About orbit synch windows, which are every months, so self-sufficiency around"
638,All our patent are belong to you
639,"Our true competition is not the small trickle of non-Tesla electric cars being produced, but rather the enormous flood of gasoline cars pouring out of the worlds factories every day"
640,Exciting to see all the new electric vehicles coming to market! We created Tesla to accelerate a sustainable future &amp; its happening!
641,Tasty food!
642,Its designed for people on a Mars journey
643,Super appreciate Deepaks year history building Tesla &amp; wish him greatest of happiness in retirement! Zach has been outstanding over his year history with Tesla &amp; will build upon Deepaks legacy.
644,"Sure, which ones?"
645,Youre most welcome! Very thoughtful questions.
646,Max Tegmark is great
647,Entropy is the source and the end of life in this instance of the Multiverse
648,guys standing on roof of skyscraper. st guy says updraft is so strong it blows you back on roof of you jump off. He jumps off &amp; is blown back on roof. nd guy tries &amp; goes splat. rd guy: that was a dirty trick Superman.
649,"If heat death will be inevitable end of Universe, it actually *is* all about journey"
650,Entropy is the ultimate boss battle
651,Haha
652,tbh smh
653,Haha true
654,SpaceX documentary actual footage
655,"All we had back then was carpet &amp; a mariachi band. Now, SPACESHIP!!"
656,Sure hope that happens
657,"Great electric car documentary about early days of Tesla, GM Volt, Nissan Leaf &amp; Gadget. So much has happened since then"
658,We are so tiny
659,"You drive a hard bargain, but ok"
660,Host meme review?
661,"Its an honor, sir! Thanks for owning a Tesla."
662,Tap Tesla logo at top of your cars touchscreen &amp; wait secs to open special features box
663,Still my favorite tweet of all time
664,"Ok, well throw that in too"
665,"But, occasionally, the metal version"
666,Haha
667,Tesla Sentry Mode will play Bachs Toccata and Fugue during a robbery (and keep Summer safe)
668,"All doors unlock automatically when the Tesla comes to a stop after an accident. There is both primary &amp; backup power to doors, brakes, steering &amp; airbags."
669,Cool that this is happening on many fronts. Looks like a good design by .
670,"Yeah, worked on my cousins farm for six weeks around my th birthday. I was so kewl."
671,Many cold weather improvements coming via OTA software
672,So tempting
673,Its like looking in a mirror!
674,That would be so cool!
675,"Yes, and my grandfather was from Minnesota with some Scandinavian/German background. Got to hand it to Norway. Thats a great sculpture!"
676,Awesome moose sculpture!
677,Rough beta in to weeks
678,Feature has now been in place for months
679,These are industrial strength. Not recommended for use at home!
680,Testing metallic heat shield at C (2000F)
681,"Sure. Also, we need to be better at remembering brightness settings."
682,The youth love em
683,"If test flight of goes well next month, will to this summer!"
684,Actual tanks are fine
685,"~1750K is peak heating expected on about % of Starship for LEO entry, ~1600K on %. Rest drops below K, so no heat shield needed. Radiative cooling at T^4 takes care of % of the ship. Another reason for steel."
686,I just heard. mph winds broke the mooring blocks late last night &amp; fairing was blown over. Will take a few weeks to repair.
687,"S stainless is better for high temp outer skin, as it can take ~1450 Kelvin, so active cooling with cryogenic fuel only has to mitigate degrees of delta temp"
688,Almost ready to roll out. Regulators just approved.
689,"Since its part of safety &amp; security, all cars with AP2+ hardware will get it"
690,Tesla Sentry Mode coming soon for all cars with Enhanced Autopilot
691,"Yes. Also, despite high outside heat, rapid water vaporization can counter-intuitively cause it to snap freeze &amp; block cooling channels."
692,Coming soon. Lots of unique road markings &amp; signs in each country.
693,"When going to ~1750 Kelvin, specific heat is more important than latent heat of vaporization, which is why cryogenic fuel is a slightly better choice than water"
694,untrue
695,Roughly to minutes for light to travel from Earth to Mars
696,Director of CERN asked me about Boring Co building the new LHC tunnel when we were at the . Would probably save several billon Euros.
697,Yes
698,Blood moon over LA tonight ()
699,The zooms around the world about every mins
700,Tesla is the safest car according to US govt testing
701,"I wish them well. Track record in auto startups is tough. Thousands of US auto startups, but only Ford &amp; Tesla have avoided bankruptcy. A similar scenario is likely in all countries."
702,Wow
703,Yup
704,"Thanks, good idea!"
705,"Yes, ending on Feb . Its adding too much cost to the cars, especially Model ."
706,Order must occur before Feb
707,"No, the whole referral incentive system will end"
708,"The Tesla customer referral program will end on Feb . If you want to refer a friend to buy a Tesla &amp; give them months of free Supercharging, please do so before then."
709,I think some of them should combine forces. Talent is spread too thin.
710,"Dragon was originally designed to land with thrusters, but its not the right architecture for heavy transport to the moon or Mars, so we decided not to qualify it for thruster landings"
711,How many electric vehicle startups are there? Seems like a lot.
712,"Teslarati is very thoughtful &amp; well-written, but this stems from a miscommunication by SpaceX"
713,"The LA Times has a long track of unreasonable attacks on SpaceX &amp; Tesla, but in this case it was our miscommunication"
714,"The source info is incorrect. Starship &amp; Raptor development is being done out of our HQ in Hawthorne, CA. We are building the Starship prototypes locally at our launch site in Texas, as their size makes them very difficult to transport."
715,Haha youre welcome! Hope youre doing well.
716,"About $15M/km for a two way high speed transit, so probably around $750M plus maybe $50M/station"
717,Glad you like it
718,Yes
719,LA is so beautiful after the rain
720,SpaceX Dragon from as seen from viewport
721,Falcon comes home
722,We are not yet offering the mid range Model in Europe
723,"Which country? There is a % import duty, ~20% VAT (US prices dont include sales tax) and about $2000 in extra shipping cost, but it shouldnt add up to $25k."
724,View of SpaceX Dragon berthed with in the last Cupola opening. Dragon (Crew Dragon) launching soon.
725,Ok
726,Obv must be more pointy tho
727,It needed to be made real
728,Haha
729,Starship Hopper will do vertical flight tests similar to the Falcon Hopper
730,Body/tank diameter is m or about ft
731,Should be done with first orbital prototype around June
732,Yes
733,Yes
734,Yes
735,"This is for suborbital VTOL tests. Orbital version is taller, has thicker skins (wont wrinkle) &amp; a smoothly curving nose section."
736,"Starship test flight rocket just finished assembly at the Texas launch site. This is an actual picture, not a rendering."
737,Yes
738,Getting some regulatory pushback. May not be available in all regions.
739,Going through final validation &amp; regulatory approval. Probably releases to early access program owners in a few weeks. Its trippy!
740,Yes
741,Tesla *with* Autopilot engaged is twice as safe &amp; continues to make steady improvements
742,Def not
743,Yes
744,"Starting on Monday, Tesla will no longer be taking orders for the kWh version of the Model S &amp; X. If youd like that version, please order by Sunday night at"
745,Good idea
746,Its an option
747,Vertically or horizontally?
748,No problem
749,"Plus, you can basically accelerate at the limit of human endurance"
750,I dont think the law fully anticipated this situation. So probably yes for a while.
751,Im not. Will use SpaceX cold gas thruster system with ultra high pressure air in a composite over-wrapped pressure vessel in place of the rear seats.
752,It will be
753,"Btw, you can buy a Tesla online in less than mins &amp; give it back for a full refund for any reason"
754,The new Roadster will actually do something like this
755,And now we dance!
756,Great thread
757,"Shanghai Giga will produce affordable versions of /Y for greater China. All Model S/X &amp; higher cost versions of Model /Y will still be built in US for WW market, incl China."
758,"Shanghai Giga output is just for greater China, not North America. Affordable cars must be made on same continent as customers."
759,Shanghai Giga production of Model /Y will serve greater China region
760,"Aiming to finish initial construction this summer, start Model production end of year &amp; reach high volume production next year"
761,Looking forward to breaking ground on the Shanghai Gigafactory today!
762,Good sign that almost no Model owners want to sell their cars!
763,"Yes, will be extremely intense. Early flights are especially dangerous, as theres a lot of new hardware."
764,"Sorry, to be clear, this pic is all real. Nothing rendered."
765,Falcon on launch pad with Crew Dragon &amp; new astronaut walkway
766,"Spiral-winding is great for uniform thickness. We used that for the Hyperloop vacuum tunnel. However, Starship skin thickness will vary considerably according to loads."
767,Exactly
768,Its all in the way you say it
769,Matt DeBord reviews all Tesla models via
770,I do love Tintin
771,More on this in a few months
772,"Starship test vehicle under assembly will look similar to this illustration when finished. Operational Starships would obv have windows, etc."
773,"Aiming for weeks, which probably means weeks, due to unforeseen issues"
774,"Good shot of Starship flight test vehicle being assembled in Boca Chica, Texas"
775,Engines currently on Starship hopper are a blend of Raptor development &amp; operational parts. First hopper engine to be fired is almost finished assembly in California. Probably fires next month.
776,Haha
777,Not yet
778,Thats a reasonable question
779,About a month away from the first orbital test flight of crew Dragon
780,Probably
781,Thats what I heard
782,Life is made of ups &amp; downs
783,Appears to be simulations all the way down
784,All parameters in a simulation are necessarily quantized
785,Three quarks for Muster Mark!
786,Wutf
787,What you think I do
788,Ok
789,srsly
790,"To a dyslexic agnostic, there is no"
791,"Evian, the first bottled water, is naive spelled backwards"
792,There are no coincidences
793,"Model mid-range EPA rating is actually miles, slightly higher than prior estimate of"
794,Checking
795,Reveals wheels?
796,"Weirdly, all the negative press seems to increase sales!"
797,"Btw, I like your gaming equipment"
798,"Sounds great, will connect you with Tesla Energy"
799,Singapore has enough area to switch to solar/battery &amp; be energy-independent
800,"Yes, support of the Chinese government is very much appreciated"
801,Govt has been unwelcome
802,Congratulations!
803,Great work by Tesla Team!
804,Congratulations team!!
805,Thanks!
806,Haha
807,Haha
808,Hope everyone has a happy New Year!
809,Happy New Year!
810,"Good summary of Tesla progress in by (due to Tesla team, not me though) via"
811,Thanks Tesla owners in China! Looking forward to visiting soon for the groundbreaking of Gigafactory Shanghai!
812,"Turns out if you take Dayquil, you exit The Matrix"
813,Excited to have Larry Ellison &amp; Kathleen Wilson-Thompson join the Tesla board!
814,Ok
815,Tesla team did a great job!
816,Yes
817,I will provide a detailed explanation in March/April
818,Time. Although it also turned out to be dramatically better.
819,Exactly
820,Yes
821,Probability at % &amp; rising rapidly due to new architecture
822,Congratulations
823,Coming soon
824,Yes
825,Got it
826,"Definitely. All major highways in Texas will have Superchargers, all the way to Brownsville &amp; across Mexico."
827,Yep
828,Yes
829,"Yes. Supercharger coverage will extend to % of Europe next year. From Ireland to Kiev, from Norway to Turkey."
830,"Most people dont know that the Tesla Supercharger network allows easy long distance travel throughout USA, most of Europe, Canada and China"
831,We are dramatically increasing Tesla Superchargers within cities &amp; working with landlords to add home charging to apartment buildings
832,Ok
833,Wow!
834,"This is incorrect. Vast majority of vehicle motion is returned to the battery, as the electric motors act like a generator in reverse. Brake pads on a Tesla literally never need to be replaced for lifetime of the car."
835,"Most importantly, every electric car, Tesla or otherwise, matters to the environment we all share. Every time someone chooses electric, the future gets a little bit brighter! If not Tesla, please take a look at these other options:"
836,"And, because electricity costs much less than gasoline, a Model can cost about $1000 less per year to operate. Because its electric, there are no oil changes, smog checks, tuneups, fuel filter, or brake pad replacements."
837,"There are also many state &amp; local incentives, for example California offers $2500, plus $800 from utilities &amp; access to carpool lane, Colorado $4000, etc"
838,Reminder to US buyers that the $7500 tax credit cuts in half in days! Order online at to see if there is any inventory left in your region or visit Tesla stores.
839,Merry Christmas &amp; goodwill to all!!
840,"No, Raptors must be shielded during atmospheric entry. Although, maybe not ..."
841,"Thanks, hope you have a good holiday! Your insight on autonomy is excellent."
842,Sigh
843,Yes
844,"Leeward side needs nothing, windward side will be activity cooled with residual (cryo) liquid methane, so will appear liquid silver even on hot side"
845,Glad youre ok!
846,Starship will look like liquid silver
847,Haha
848,Maybe
849,Much less
850,Skin will get too hot for paint. Stainless mirror finish. Maximum relfectivity.
851,"Usable strength/weight of full hard stainless at cryo is slightly better than carbon fiber, room temp is worse, high temp is vastly better"
852,"Yes, signal acquired from that dish"
853,Stainless Steel Starship
854,Which seems to be the approximate pixel size of reality
855,When its no longer noticeable over Plancks length
856,Yes! People are almost always surprised to learn that Earths gravitational reach is infinite. Zero gravity is achieved by zooming around Earth super fast until outward acceleration equals inward acceleration of gravity.
857,At SpaceX Boca Chica launch site in Texas
858,Amazing space progress by China. This year they did more orbital launches than the USA for the first time.
859,Engineering is true magic
860,Yezzz
861,How bizarre. Sorry to hear that.
862,Putting in little outward-facing speakers would open up a lot of opportunities
863,Please put invented car fart on my gravestone. This is my only request.
864,Our superalloy foundry is now almost fully operational. This allows rapid iteration on Raptor.
865,"SpaceX metallurgy team developed SX500 superalloy for psi, hot oxygen-rich gas. It was hard. Almost any metal turns into a flare in those conditions."
866,Thanks!
867,"Its embarrassing that Boeing/Lockheed need to use a Russian engine on Atlas, but that engine design is brilliant"
868,You def dont want electric pumps on a rocket engine! Raptor turbopumps alone need horsepower per engine. Thats not a typo.
869,"Yes, full flow, gas-gas, staged combustion. Will take us time to work up to bar. That is a mad level."
870,Yes. Radically redesigned Raptor ready to fire next month.
871,"Seriously! We are just on the wrong planet for SSTO. Mars, no problem."
872,"Starlink V1 on Falcon, V2+ on Starship. Basically, all future products will contain either the word star or link"
873,"Yes, but single stage to orbit with no payload is pointless. Add Super Heavy rocket booster &amp; orbital payload is gigantic. Only need booster on Earth, due to deep gravity well &amp; thick atmosphere. Starship alone on moons &amp; Mars."
874,Coldformed at cryo
875,"This test hopper is at full body diameter of m / ft, just not full height. Super Heavy will be full height &amp; diameter."
876,Were building subsections of the Starship Mk I orbital design there
877,Exactly
878,"For sheet/plate, at supplier made to our spec. For cast, in our Hawthorne foundry."
879,Yes
880,"I will do a full technical presentation of Starship after the test vehicle were building in Texas flies, so hopefully March/April"
881,"Yup. Actually, the only significant design element in common with early Atlas is stainless steel &amp; were using a different alloy mix. I super Series Stainless!"
882,"While there are some material similarities, Starship is very different from the Atlas design"
883,"Stainless steel is correct, but different mixture of alloys &amp; new architecture. Unlike Atlas, Starship is buckling stable on launchpad even when unpressurized."
884,"If Tesla committed delivery &amp; customer made good faith efforts to receive before year end, Tesla will cover the tax credit difference"
885,Coming soon
886,"It will be tight, but Tesla production should have all mid-range Model orders delivered by year end"
887,Try connecting to WiFi
888,"Tesla has released all cars for sale where original customer cant take delivery before year end, as well as test drive / display cars, which cost less. Reminder to US buyers that $7500 tax credit drops in half in days. Order online at or visit stores."
889,Only if Dawkins joins
890,Interesting
891,Bajirao Mastani
892,"Anxiety is a scalar, fear is a vector"
893,Yes
894,Haha
895,Namaste
896,Needs a warmup
897,Must feel amazing up there in microgravity zooming around the Earth every minutes! Hope you have a Merry Christmas!
898,"Thanks, will consider next year"
899,"So long as the tunnels are spaced about one diameter apart, most of the stress will flow around them, but this wont matter for the first few layers"
900,Tesla phone app release next week will enable service scheduling in mins with a few taps. No more need to call!
901,"As a thank you to Tesla short sellers, we named a after them haha"
902,"Perhaps lost in the transport debate is that built a ft tunnel in LA for ~$10M with V1 (Godot). Next tunnel will be made with V2 (Line-Storm). V3 (Prufrock), aspirationally X better, should be operational next year. For reference:"
903,Join our underground movement!
904,"Reverse back down (using same roller guide wheels, so no skill required) &amp; tow or flatbed it out"
905,Ok
906,Autopilot doesnt need the guide wheels. Theyre only there if there is a complete system failure. Turns will definitely be banked in future.
907,Are tunnels safe in an earthquake?
908,Exactly
909,"The guides are basically just a wheel, a shock absorber &amp; a solenoid. Costs a few hundred dollars in volume."
910,"Yeah, it would allow many streets to become parks and walking areas. Less concrete, more trees."
911,"Probably only need three types: straight ramp, spiral ramp &amp; elevator. Latter only for tight spaces."
912,"Passive lateral safety is required by regulators &amp; I think theyre right. Might be able to build this into the tunnel wall though. So long as the vehicle is prevented by physics from rolling or jackknifing, there is probably a good safety argument."
913,"Youre right. We did have a sim ready, but it was confusing, so I didnt include it. Were working on one that makes things clear."
914,"Pop up, park and walk!"
915,I know that area well. Best would be to add ramps into the tunnel system from the basement levels of the parking lots surrounding rd St.
916,"If all vehicles were densely seated buses, throughput in excess of people per hour per lane is possible, but better to offer a range of vehicles &amp; let people decide what makes them happy"
917,"A variety of vehicles, like normal roads, from a small car to a densely seated bus. Must be seated &amp; belted for high speed safety."
918,Next step for Loop is demonstrating high throughput at high speed. Target is vehicles/hour at mph (250km/h).
919,Precisely
920,Presentation starting at :15
921,"This *is* affordable mass transit, but better in that it takes you where and when you to go"
922,"The demo ride takes you in *same* car on road, down elevator, zips through tunnel using guide wheels, up elevator at destination &amp; then drives on normal roads back to start"
923,"Actually way more capacity, way faster &amp; way more convenient. Subways are fine, but its time to upgrade to something better."
924,All Boring Loops will include continuously circulating cars dedicated to pedestrians &amp; cyclists
925,"Capable of traveling safely at over mph. At that speed, it will feel like teleporting within a city."
926,Yes
927,"This can be applied to any autonomous, electric vehicle, not just Tesla"
928,Tesla in tunnel with retractable wheel gear that turns a car into a rail-guided train &amp; back again
929,Boring product launch will be streamed live at pm California time tonight
930,Boring is developing an entirely new system of transport
931,Same applies to those who didnt order PUP
932,Exactly. Its a good way to go. Get people with more money to pay for the development!
933,"Yeah, I wrote that back in , almost years ago!"
934,"Clayton is wrong. New tech is always expensive. Tech disruption occurs at *high end*, eg computers &amp; cell phones. It takes many design iterations &amp; vast economies of scale to achieve mass market affordability."
935,Honored to work with amazing teams at SpaceX &amp; Tesla!
936,Totally false. Buried in this incredibly misleading WSJ article is the actual statement from Thiels Founders Fund: we have no concerns whatsoever.
937,"Same facts, same period of time, but extremely different reporting"
938,Tis
939,Medieval Futurism
940,Tesla app almost done. Important to get every note right!
941,Thanks!
942,The white seats are actually extremely stain resistant. You can spill red wine on the seats &amp; just wipe it off.
943,Congratulations!
944,"In other words, you may be able to get a Tesla before the $7500 US tax credit drops in weeks, even if you havent placed an order yet"
945,You got it
946,Pretty good. I have confirmation turned off on my engineering build &amp; interventions are rare. Probably ready to enable no confirmation setting next month.
947,Zero Suit
948,God Fire
949,ramen is sooo good
950,Exactly
951,This part is true. I was trying to explain that we dont want our cars to have a tinny sound.
952,You should def have a loaner. Will take care of it.
953,Seems likely that well be able to reuse fairings that soft-landed in the ocean. May not need net at all. Would still love to see the catch happen though
954,"Incorrect. Chairman is an honorific, not executive role, which means its not needed to run Tesla. Will retire that title at Tesla in years. Mins edited out end of my sentence, where I said I could do whatever I want. They cut provided I have the support of shareholders."
955,About to days
956,"Also, Tesla policy is that if you order a car without a test drive you get days to return for full refund vs day if you do get a test drive (resources are overbooked)"
957,"Important note for US Tesla buyers: Federal tax credit drops by $3750 in weeks. To be on the cancellation waitlist for delivery this year or if you want a display car, order at or visit our stores. Full refund if Tesla cant deliver your car this year."
958,No need to wait. Its super easy to swap the HW2 and HW3 computers. Sensors are the same.
959,Im dying to make a pickup truck so bad we might have a prototype to unveil next year
960,Yes
961,"Love that people are buying a Tesla for the product itself, even if they dont believe in climate change. Not everyone can be convinced about global warming, but if an electric car is simply the best product, they dont need to be."
962,Probably next month
963,Youre right. There was a ton of footage with many people at Tesla that would be great to share. Longer pieces like we did with tell a more interesting story.
964,"Were opening a lot of Tesla service centers next year, including Knoxville. Tesla will post upcoming city opening map this week."
965,Probably end of next year
966,So true
967,This is a very misleading edit. Please post the full transcript where I complete the sentence.
968,"Mins actually had several hours of interview time, which they distilled to mins. Many stories could been told with that time. This was accurate as viewed from an Upper East Side Manhattan dinner party."
969,We are awaiting EU regulatory approval for this release
970,"Full self-driving option is required with the Tesla designed hardware computer. This is a simple plug in replacement for the NVidia computer, but has over X the image processing ability."
971,"Already testing traffic lights, stop signs &amp; roundabouts in development software. Your Tesla will soon be able to go from your garage at home to parking at work with no driver input at all."
972,"If you have a Tesla built in past years, definitely try Navigate on Autopilot. It will blow your mind. Automatically passes slow cars &amp; takes highway interchanges &amp; off-ramps."
973,Machete!!
974,"It was supposed to be, but that was a dumb decision. In the end, Roadster only had % of parts in common with the Lotus Elise or any other car."
975,"Major credit to AC Propulsion for the tzero electric sports car -2003 that inspired Tesla Roadster. Without that, Tesla wouldnt exist or would have started much later."
976,"Yeah, we wanted to name our company after Tesla, the great scientist/engineer, but use of the Tesla name in automotive was already trademarked in the US, Europe &amp; later China."
977,"Buying took over a decade, $11M &amp; amazing amount of effort. Didnt like even when we were only making ."
978,"Tesla history trivia: we didnt actually come up with the Tesla Motors name. Bought trademark off Brad Siewert for $75k in late . Hed originally filed for it in . Our alternative name was Faraday, which was used by a competitor several years later."
979,"Both, but demo Starship is being built now, whereas Super Heavy hardware will start getting built in spring"
980,But cool pics of the demo Starship that will fly suborbital hops coming in ~4 weeks
981,Yes
982,Interesting
983,"Fairly heavy metal, but extremely strong"
984,The new design is metal
985,"As far as we know, its the largest single piece titanium casting in the world. Major improvement over the old aluminum grid fins, as the titanium doesnt need heat shielding or even paint."
986,Boring Company product launch on Dec . More than a tunnel opening. Will include modded but fully road legal autonomous transport cars &amp; ground to tunnel car elevators.
987,Tracking shot of Falcon water landing
988,"Engines stabilized rocket spin just in time, enabling an intact landing in water! Ships en route to rescue Falcon."
989,"Pump is single string. Some landing systems are not redundant, as landing is considered ground safety critical, but not mission critical. Given this event, we will likely add a backup pump &amp; lines."
990,We may use it for an internal SpaceX mission
991,"Yes, cutaway was a mistake. We will show all footage, good or bad."
992,"Grid fin hydraulic pump stalled, so Falcon landed just out to sea. Appears to be undamaged &amp; is transmitting data. Recovery ship dispatched."
993,Falcon/Dragon launch to in minutes
994,Us too sigh
995,"Falcon fairing halves missed the net, but touched down softly in the water. Mr Steven is picking them up. Plan is to dry them out &amp; launch again. Nothing wrong with a little swim."
996,satellites on this flight!
997,"Were adding police car, fire truck &amp; ambulance to the Tesla neural net in coming months"
998,"Exactly. Default Autopilot behavior, if theres no driver input, is to slow gradually to a stop &amp; turn on hazard lights. Tesla service then contacts the owner. Looking into what happened here."
999,It is so hard to move in armor!
1000,Youre all hired!
1001,Yes no maybe
1002,None shall pass!
1003,Ok
1004,Good advice
1005,Applying a hydrophobic coating to the radar (located just below nose of car) should help. Easy to do yourself or Tesla service can do it. Were also working on vision-only driving.
1006,Glad youre ok
1007,"Perhaps most telling is that Norway, which is partly above the Arctic Circle, has more Teslas per capita than any other country on Earth."
1008,"As the battery warms up, almost all of that is recovered. There is a roughly % range loss for cabin heating. Cabin heating impact on range is higher in slow traffic, but range is also higher in slow traffic."
1009,"Incoming rocket &amp; fairing probably visible, but landing itself is over the horizon"
1010,You got it!
1011,"Three things, one of which is CH4"
1012,No
1013,No
1014,"Reentry scorchmarks, not simple soot. Cant wipe it off."
1015,Haha
1016,"Prof Dahn is correct (hes great), but the relative benefit is small. Id recommend % more SoC for convenience."
1017,"Not worth going below % imo. Even % is still fine. Also, no issue going to % or lower SoC."
1018,True
1019,Both
1020,Your Tesla can function as a boat for brief periods of time
1021,One day
1022,"Were doing an EIR for the greater LA tunnel network. Thought we might need a N-S test tunnel (hence Sepulveda proposal), but were just going to do rock core samples along that corridor instead."
1023,Update soon
1024,Sorry
1025,Boring breakthrough
1026,Definitely
1027,"After safety, our goal is to make a Tesla the most fun you could possibly have in a car"
1028,We tried. Nintendo wont license it to us.
1029,That would be cool
1030,Haha kinda true
1031,Never heard of it
1032,"Super fun software Easter eggs coming to all Tesla S/3/X cars before the holidays! Romance mode, toilet humor &amp; more video games."
1033,Software upgrade to rain sensing neural net coming next month
1034,Yes
1035,"This is completely backwards. Based on what weve learned from the Hawthorne test tunnel, were moving forward with a much larger tunnel network under LA. Wont need a second test tunnel under Sepulveda."
1036,"Cool! Actually, if you buy a Tesla without a test drive, you have days to return it. If you buy after a test drive, you still have hours. Trying to incent buying with no test drive."
1037,Tiny wizard
1038,to years
1039,"Engineers, artists &amp; creators of all kinds. There is so much to build."
1040,Touch
1041,"But if you love what you do, it (mostly) doesnt feel like work"
1042,"Varies per person, but about sustained, peaking above at times. Pain level increases exponentially above ."
1043,"There are way easier places to work, but nobody ever changed the world on hours a week"
1044,"Join to create exciting new worlds of technology!! If getting things done matters to you, then , , &amp; are the places to be."
1045,Congratulations! What an amazing track record of success with Mars!
1046,liters of pure water costs $1
1047,"For those worried about running out of fresh water, it may help to know that desalination only costs cents per liter or half a cent per gallon"
1048,Ah yes fair point
1049,"Used to live in Silicon Valley, now I live in Silicone Valley"
1050,Not yet
1051,trouble
1052,Earth is
1053,"Earths crust is only ~1% of Earth mass, so technically we should be called Lava"
1054,"Earth should be called Water. Our surface is % water. Mars land area is roughly equal to Earth, as its all land. Even when warmed up &amp; water ice turns liquid, Mars will be about /3 land."
1055,"Yeah, good idea to offer that as a setting"
1056,"Contour remains approx same, but fundamental materials change to airframe, tanks &amp; heatshield"
1057,"If you dont want a Tesla, heres a list of all electric cars in North America via"
1058,Signing off for a while
1059,Happy Thanksgiving!!
1060,Starships were meant to fly
1061,Starship Tooters
1062,Good one
1063,Good idea
1064,Coming soon
1065,Shifting resources from sales to service for next several days
1066,Should be next week
1067,"No, its the first or boost stage, analogous to, but much larger than Falcon"
1068,Later versions will
1069,"Technically, two parts: Starship is the spaceship/upper stage &amp; Super Heavy is the rocket booster needed to escape Earths deep gravity well (not needed for other planets or moons)"
1070,Renaming BFR to Starship
1071,"No, were just going to accelerate BFR"
1072,Yes
1073,"Supercharger V3, which starts rolling out early next year, will also charge much faster"
1074,Tesla Supercharger capacity will double by end of next year. Expect to be within range of % to % of population in all active markets.
1075,"No, its got enough load capacity &amp; volume to carry the battery pack &amp; our current pack energy density is about double that of original Roadster. Still, it would probably only save about % to % of effort, all things considered."
1076,"In order of resource priority, but not necessarily production ramp, as that depends on thousands of parts &amp; processes, which are extremely difficult to forecast"
1077,"What really matters is time to volume production, not initial market intro. Apart from brief moments, Tesla vehicle production is limited by total battery output."
1078,"Lot on our plate, so its either get van gliders (no battery, powertrain or compute tech) from Daimler &amp; produce sooner or do all &amp; produce later. Not a big difference to total vehicles produced either way. Priority list is Model Y, solar roof tiles, pickup, semi, Roadster."
1079,Ok
1080,Maybe interesting to work with Daimler/Mercedes on an electric Sprinter. Thats a great van. We will inquire.
1081,Absolutely agree
1082,Investigating
1083,Probably mid
1084,Tesla can provide heating/cooling/lights/music for days using battery
1085,"Not everywhere, but should be possible around major metros. Parts supply chain to UK should be fixed. Lmk if not."
1086,Should be possible. Please ask service &amp; lmk response.
1087,"No, but perhaps in a few years"
1088,"Yeah, good idea. We have that state internally, so can push data to phone app."
1089,"Haha, just like Super Troopers"
1090,Ideal situation in breakdown/accident (assuming no injuries) is that Tesla arrives at scene fast with top-of-the-line service loaner
1091,Will allow having your car picked up &amp; dropped off or using mobile Tesla Rangers service vans if car lift isnt needed
1092,Adding functionality to Tesla phone app allowing owners to request service for top issues with or taps
1093,"Yes, no upgrades planned for F9. Minor tweaks to improve reliability only, provided NASA &amp; USAF are supportive."
1094,Radical change
1095,"Btw, SpaceX is no longer planning to upgrade Falcon second stage for reusability. Accelerating BFR instead. New design is very exciting! Delightfully counter-intuitive."
1096,It will alert Tesla service automatically as fan power required to achieve target pressure drop exceeds spec level
1097,"Set air flow to recirculating mode &amp; manually raise blower speed to in Model for best air quality. Air filters are smaller than S/X, so clear air is achieved by circulating through filter several times."
1098,Congratulations on completing the LA/Hawthorne tunnel! Cutting edge technology!
1099,Boring Company just broke through the other side!!
1100,Missed miku concert sigh
1101,Listening to Better Now
1102,"China, especially, is doing an amazing job moving towards sustainable energy generation &amp; transport"
1103,"Sure hope this isnt true. It is the non-linearities, such as Siberian permafrost melting or ocean currents changing, that are most difficult to predict."
1104,Haha
1105,Looking back at the sun from upper stage &amp; Falcon landed on drone ship Of Course I Still Love You
1106,$5 per min to argue with knight. $12 for min bulk discount.
1107,While (!castle) {brick++};
1108,Watchtower (feat. knight) will be at LA/Hawthorne tunnel entrance
1109,Fortnite irl
1110,Boring Co is launching a whole product line of DIY watchtowers. You get bricks &amp; a picture.
1111,"Um, that is not our castle. I just found a picture on the Internet."
1112,Not much but it is ours
1113,The Boring Company is building a watchtower in LA out of dirt bricks &amp; we need a knight to yell insults at people in a French accent
1114,"We have to truck to departure rail head &amp; truck from arrival rail head, which is usually from customers. Car gets moved around rail yard a lot too &amp; trains dont leave often."
1115,"Probably some deliveries in March, but April is more certain"
1116,Yes
1117,"Will also be using dedicated roll-on, roll-off fast ships for transporting cars to Europe &amp; Asia in Q1. Major focus on minimizing time from factory to new owner. Did not fully appreciate the working capital impact until recently."
1118,We bought some trucking companies &amp; secured contracts with major haulers to avoid trucking shortage mistake of last quarter
1119,Probably technically able to do so in about a year. Then up to regulators.
1120,"Skipping rail saves over a month for East Coast deliveries. All things considered, its better to use trucks. Single load/unload &amp; direct to owner location."
1121,Tesla just acquired trucking capacity to ensure Model can be delivered in US by Dec if ordered by Nov
1122,We will fight Big Tequila!
1123,That would be awesome
1124,Easily accessible energy
1125,Send me a note!
1126,Would be fun to add to Tesla
1127,Yes
1128,Will try again next month
1129,"Congratulations team! Thanks , much appreciated."
1130,"Rest in peace, Stan Lee. The many worlds of imagination &amp; delight you created for humanity will last forever."
1131,Is he ok?
1132,"It naturally follows that a hotter system will have more energetic events. For example, as a pot of water becomes colder, it becomes inert ice, but heating a pot of water turns it into a steam boiler."
1133,Scary sign of times to come. It will get worse.
1134,"Agreed, technically, mined hydrocarbons come primarily from ancient, decayed marine organisms &amp; partially from geological processes (CH4 particularly)"
1135,"Makes me so mad when smart, ethical scientists I know are accused of publishing climate papers for grant money. They earn vs their other opportunities, but give that up to help world. But their accusers make billions by slowing down clean energy. Which is more credible?"
1136,"That is true &amp; should be applauded. Right move is for oil companies truly to think of themselves as energy companies, but move rapidly towards clean, sustainable energy. Means lower profits short-term, but will make them stronger long-term."
1137,"We know well run out of dead dinosaurs to mine for fuel &amp; have to use sustainable energy eventually, so why not go renewable now &amp; avoid increasing risk of climate catastrophe? Betting that science is wrong &amp; oil companies are right is the dumbest experiment in history by far"
1138,Because people on the ground know more about whats actually needed than politicians do
1139,"Good, but not hospital grade. S &amp; X were designed to be proof against an actual bioweapon attack. Requires a giant filter with separate acid &amp; alkaline gas neutralization layers. Not enough room in Model ."
1140,"If Tesla can help people in California wildfire, please let us know. Model S &amp; X have hospital grade HEPA filters. Maybe helpful for transporting people."
1141,"Fair point, will reenable"
1142,"Agreed, top priority for Autopilot team. Being cautious for max safety."
1143,Please lmk what youd most like improved/fixed about your Tesla. Thanks!
1144,Cool
1145,"With similar track wheels/tires/brakes, Model S P100D is faster"
1146,Yes
1147,Would like to thank Robyn for joining the team. Great respect. Very much look forward to working together.
1148,"No, were building a BFR dev ship to do supersonic through landing tests in Boca Chica, Texas"
1149,Wont land propulsively for those reasons. Ultra light heat shield &amp; high Mach control surfaces are what we cant test well without orbital entry. I think we have a handle on propulsive landings.
1150,Aiming for orbital flight by June
1151,Mod to SpaceX tech tree build: Falcon second stage will be upgraded to be like a mini-BFR Ship
1152,But comments are
1153,LA/Hawthorne demonstration tunnel activates Dec . Runs parallel to freeway from Crenshaw Blvd to .
1154,"I think Twitter is deleting fake, scam or maybe even inactive accounts. My follower count decreased by ~20k over the past few days."

1163,Oh hi guys lol
1164,"Yes, Germany has outstanding engineering talent"
1165,"Just a few mins, which is mostly accelerating &amp; decelerating"
1166,So underappreciated
1167,Ok
1168,Ok
1169,Walked full length of Boring Co tunnel under LA tonight. Disturbingly long. On track for opening party Dec . Will be very one-dimensional.
1170,"Sounds like pure luxury! When I said sponge, I was actually speaking metaphorically. Truth is, I was just a simple nucleotide, drifting alone in small crevice with trillion siblings."
1171,What is love?
1172,Bikini Bottom
1173,Fair
1174,"Yes, that is how"
1175,We didnt even have kids back then. Just little sponges.
1176,Sea sponge. Humans would later use our bodies to clean dishes. So humiliating.
1177,Wow thats cool!
1178,Kids these days have it easy
1179,I remember when I was a sponge. Simpler times they were.
1180,Haha
1181,First movie I ever saw in theaters
1182,When the only existing life was a sponge
1183,Although it was in the precambrian era
1184,Star Wars only had an $11M budget. Must have been in the galaxy of ridiculously low budgets.
1185,Theyre great! Honored to work with them.
1186,Yes
1187,Definitely
1188,"Aspirationally, they will be made to the exact same specification, but we can vary cell quantity to account for empirical variation"
1189,"Hopefully, partial presence in India, Africa &amp; South America end of next year, with broader expansion in"
1190,"Recently asked service team to expand locations to all population regions (not just major metros) in North America, Eastern Europe, China &amp; Japan by end of next year. We are completely missing vast geographic regions in some cases."
1191,"To clarify further, the long-term goal for Tesla mass market products is local production for local markets (at least at the continent level). This is critical to make pricing as affordable as possible."
1192,"Tesla will manufacture all battery modules &amp; packs at China Giga, as we do today in California &amp; Nevada. Cell production will be sourced locally, most likely from several companies (incl Pana), in order to meet demand in a timely manner."
1193,"Amazing results by at Tesla Gigafactory Nevada! Very much appreciate extreme hard work it took to achieve this result. Together with Pana Japan cell plants, Tesla/Pana partnership is producing ~60% of global EV battery output!"
1194,Prob to weeks
1195,v true
1196,cute
1197,Haha
1198,Bring Me the Horizon
1199,Aiming for next week
1200,Norway
1201,"r wrong, but in Tesla makes s overseas &amp; East Coast in st half of quarter"
1202,"Long-term, the car will work purely on vision, with radar just a plus, but maybe worth adding a radar heater anyway"
1203,We can make it work from very far away. LoS is just for safety.
1204,Hahaha &lt;ahem&gt;
1205,Um yes
1206,"Maybe AI will make me follow it, laugh like a demon &amp; say whos the pet now"
1207,"Also, youll be able to drive it from your phone remotely like a big RC car if in line of sight"
1208,Car will drive to your phone location &amp; follow you like a pet if you hold down summon button on Tesla app
1209,"Tesla advanced Summon ready in ~6 weeks! Just an over-the-air software upgrade, so will work on all cars made in past years (Autopilot hardware V2+)."
1210,Scientists uncover Sneaky move by GM
1211,"For those unfamiliar, this uses Tesla Autopark/Summon. Slightly smarter version hopefully ready soon. By next year, a Tesla should be able to drive around a parking lot, find an empty spot, read signs to confirm its valid &amp; park."
1212,Cool haha
1213,"Legally required officers of a corporation are president, treasurer &amp; secretary. Guess I have to keep st one or it will confuse the authorities."
1214,"Good point, might put that one back"
1215,Deleted my Tesla titles last week to see what would happen. Im now the Nothing of Tesla. Seems fine so far.
1216,Signing off Twitter for a few days ...
1217,"Dont worry, well make it right"
1218,The FOIA on this will be solid gold. Cant wait.
1219,Not going up. We will just offer those who ordered bought P either $5k back or free lifetime Supercharging.
1220,"Its a reasonable criticism. We wanted to make the awesome version of Model Performance more affordable, but it was arguably too much too soon. Taking corrective action"
1221,"Exactly, this is total bs. What part of production hell sounds like a sure thing!?"
1222,We will enable track mode for all performance cars
1223,"It was underpriced. Anyway, if you want $5k refund &amp; free Supercharging turned off, we will do that."
1224,"Ok, we will turn off lifetime free Supercharging and give you $5k refund"
1225,"Yeah, or free lifetime Supercharging, whichever you prefer"
1226,Didnt you get free Supercharging for life? Current buyers dont get that.
1227,Exactly. Thats Monday.
1228,"Yes. Will require tapping indicator to confirm at first. When safety looks good after M miles of driving or so, there will be an option to turn off confirm."
1229,"No, but I will"
1230,Isnt it obvious?
1231,Worth it
1232,True
1233,Tesla Autopilot Drive on Navigation going to wide release in North America tonight
1234,"Not exactly. We just bundled the upgrade package into Performance. No problem if you want to return the car, but I think lifetime free Supercharging is a good deal."
1235,Haha
1236,"On Insta, % of followers like even lame posts. On Twitter, good posts get %."
1237,Lacks scale
1238,"Reddit is massive, but def has gems"
1239,"Reddits twitter account is lame, because its not real Reddit"
1240,Exactly
1241,Youre right. Earlier Model Performance buyers got free lifetime Supercharging. Will add that to anyone who bought recently.
1242,"On Twitter, likes are rare &amp; criticism is brutal. So hardcore. Its great."
1243,Glad youre ok
1244,"S is better, but rear seat folds down in Model , so bikes can fit in trunk"
1245,Hey thats my Halloween costume!
1246,Good question
1247,"Clearly, youre not reading my twitter"
1248,I wish
1249,Taking action. Tesla body shops now operating in California aiming for same day body repair in most cases.
1250,Yes Zorbix
1251,"Sir, I would never"
1252,"Yes, I am a little girl. Ok, not that little. Or a girl."

1269,Not moths tho
1270,Send me ur dankest memes!!
1271,in
1272,Fresh puro from my meme dealer
1273,Exactly. There are many states where we are not allowed to sell cars at all or are severely restricted to literally one store.
1274,"Model was top-selling car in US by revenue despite no advertising, no paid endorsements &amp; no discounts. Competitors spent billions on marketing. Model was product alone."
1275,Massive thanks to Tesla owners &amp; supporters. We wouldnt be here without you.
1276,Same
1277,Howd they know!?
1278,Around mid
1279,"There have been hundreds of improvements to fit &amp; finish over the years, but no major step change in this regard. Seats, especially, are dramatically better now than in the past."
1280,Only thing almost anyone would notice is the nose
1281,Just did that to correct the front design esthetic of Model S. The nose of an electric car shouldnt look like a radiator grill opening.
1282,"Get this question a lot, so need to clarify that theres no such thing as a Tesla refresh. Other car companies do this every ~3 years, but Tesla constantly upgrades vehicle hardware every week."
1283,"To simplify production, many Tesla Model S &amp; X interior configs, will no longer be available after Nov . Order now to be sure of the one you want."
1284,"Model body design could def be less complex, but, yes, most of weight difference is due to higher safety vs other cars"
1285,Working on it
1286,That is correct
1287,Twitter thought I got hacked &amp; locked my account haha
1288,Wanna buy some Bitcoin?
1289,And I own a chibi Wolverine

1294,"Hopefully, a few months for Drive on Navigation capability. We need to address differences in how lane lines are painted. Varies greatly by country."
1295,Good point
1296,Interesting
1297,"This is a ~ ft demo tunnel. First operational, high-speed tunnel still set for Chicago, pending regulatory approvals."
1298,Under LA (Hawthorne)
1299,mph | km/h
1300,Opening event that night &amp; free rides for the public next day
1301,"Pretty close, actually"
1302,I think real
1303,Opens Dec
1304,The first tunnel is almost done
1305,N00B!
1306,Twitter is Dark Souls of social media. Reddit is Bloodborne. Insta is Zelda.
1307,Good idea!
1308,"This game is my personal favorite, but I am biased towards space stuff"
1309,Coming soon
1310,Turn on enhanced security via the settings page. This will require entering a passcode to use the car.
1311,Digital Style!
1312,Would I really let someone get away with using my name all this time?
1313,BoredElonMusk is my secret troll account. Its time people knew.
1314,"No, bored me, I will not"
1315,Maybe phone as controller
1316,Exactly
1317,Coming
1318,Yes
1319,Reality is hard
1320,Online doesnt count
1321,Coming soon
1322,No
1323,Thats next
1324,Had to been done ur welcome
1325,I hope this is true!
1326,"If you dont like a Tesla for any reason or no reason, you can just give it back for a full refund"
1327,Also available off menu for a week. Was causing too much confusion.
1328,"Model long range, rear wheel drive is still available for ordering off menu for another week or so"
1329,"Its kind of like the post office. Same price for delivery to Maine as the SF Bay Area. But you do get a free Tesla factory tour, which is really fun to see."
1330,"Tesla rear wheel drive cars do actually work well on snow &amp; ice. We did our traction testing on an ice lake! Dual motor AWD is great, but not required for cold weather. Just dont use sport/summer tires."
1331,"Its a long range battery with fewer cells. Non-cell portion of the pack is disproportionately high, but we can get it done now instead of ~February"
1332,"Just released lower cost, mid-range Tesla Model &amp; super simple new order page"
1333,Week or two
1334,Love the Reddit comments too
1335,Dog saves her puppies
1336,y
1337,Youll see
1338,Tomorrow brings a lemur
1339,Special Circumstances
1340,Yes
1341,New Summon will use the Autopilot cameras
1342,"Yes, aiming for next few months"
1343,"True, but this will improve dramatically over next several months &amp; all Tesla cars ever produced (except early Roadsters) will get improvements for free. Continuous, free over-the-air software updates is a big part of why a Tesla retains so much value over time."
1344,Same goes for all countries within which we officially operate by end of next year
1345,Just reviewed Teslas service locations in North America &amp; realized we have major gaps in geographic coverage! Sorry for this foolish oversight. Tesla will aim to cover all regions of NA (not just big cities) within to months.
1346,Insightful article by David
1347,"Thanks John, really admire you too! I think youre one of the best engineers ever. Hope you return to working on rockets one day."
1348,The FSD upgrade is the Tesla computer with our NN chip
1349,I believe its $5k
1350,~6 months before it is in all new production cars. No change to sensors. This is simple replacement of the Autopilot computer. Will be done free of charge for those who ordered full self-driving.
1351,Somewhere between % &amp; %
1352,"To be clear, actual NN improvement is significantly overestimated in this article. V9.0 vs V8.1 is more like a ~400% increase in useful ops/sec due to enabling integrated GPU &amp; better use of discrete GPU."
1353,"This is without the Tesla NN computer. Per my public comments, that will give the car an extra order of magnitude."
1354,Still a long way to go
1355,Model motor &amp; gearbox still in good condition after driving M miles. Designed for ultra high endurance.
1356,Works best if you play games full screen &amp; use steering wheel scroller balls for control
1357,Haha. It is actually my fav game on Tesla cars right now
1358,What are some of the most fun games we could have on a Tesla? Classic Atari is just the start.
1359,Yes
1360,Thanks for recognizing the great work of the Tesla team! people now.

1367,Towelie
1368,Good idea!
1369,Whole beer keg fits in Model trunk!
1370,"Wow, mechanical logic gates"
1371,Comes with free towels. Nothing more useful in the entire Universe.
1372,Maybe wise to bring it just in case
1373,About half my money is intended to help problems on Earth &amp; half to help establish a self-sustaining city on Mars to ensure continuation of life (of all species) in case Earth gets hit by a meteor like the dinosaurs or WW3 happens &amp; we destroy ourselves
1374,You should ask why I would want money. The reason is not what you think. Very little time for recreation. Dont have vacation homes or yachts or anything like that.
1375,Yes
1376,"Tesla exists to help reduce risk of catastrophic climate change, which affects all species on Earth. Even if your faith in humanity is faltering, this is worth caring about. Support makes a difference. Thank you."
1377,Visual approximation
1378,Teslaquila coming soon
1379,Glad youre safe
1380,Beautiful picture
1381,"Yes, its hard to find. Not sure why."
1382,"Exactly. A Tesla is objectively much safer in a crash than all other cars, according to NHTSAs *own* calculations. This is just physics!"
1383,This is incorrect
1384,At Falcon LZ-1 Vandenberg on Sunday night with the Base Commander. Support of much appreciated.
1385,Studebaker Museum in South Bend
1386,Punctuality is not my strong suit
1387,Wed be nothing without our fans
1388,Because is obviously louder than
1389,No such thing as a full refresh at Tesla or even a model year. Our cars are partially upgraded every month as soon as a new subsystem is ready for production. There is no cadence.
1390,It sure does. Very reliable.
1391,You are right
1392,A reminder of why its important to accelerate advent of cars powered by electricity made from solar power
1393,"Youre most welcome, glad I could be helpful! Thanks for letting me know about it."

1400,My fav character
1401,Sonic boom warning. This wont be subtle.
1402,Two one for millions of years from now and one for you
1403,Yes
1404,"Yes, but in that were creating a generalized autonomy solution. Must work in millions of strange situations."
1405,Blade Runner Esper Edition Vangelis
1406,"Actually, its of forward cameras in rear view mirror assembly. External cameras will auto-activate in future if car is damaged while parked."
1407,Fair point
1408,"When something sounds too good to be true, it usually is. Way the trick works is companies like Blackrock keep up to % of short interest revenue, but suffer almost none of equity decline, as theyre just passive managers. Blackrock made $597M in short lending last year!"
1409,"Not all. However, shorting applied to market as a whole is obv net negative it incents negative gdp! Moreover, it stops private companies from going public, preventing access by retirement funds &amp; small investors, thus increasing wealth divide."
1410,V9 moving to wide release now. Holding back Autopilot drive on navigation for a few more weeks of validation. Extremely difficult to achieve a general solution for self-driving that works well everywhere.
1411,Only if theyre extremely tiny
1412,We dont judge. Any pic you want!
1413,Tesla owners can refer someone to buy a Tesla &amp; get any image they want laser etched in glass &amp; sent to deep space for millions of years

1415,First Falcon land landing mission from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California coming up soon!
1416,The CIO of a major pension fund is the one who deserves credit for uncovering this scam
1417,"The big funds can &amp; will, as theyre suffering a net loss. Index managers like Blackrock pocket make excessive profit from short lending while pretending to charge low rates for passive index tracking."
1418,"Debatably true, if applied to individual stocks selectively &amp; consciously, but obv false if applied broadly to most of the market &amp; without clear consent of the shareholder"
1419,"Where this breaks down is in passive index funds, which constitute most of the market. The holders of those funds, mostly small investors &amp; retirement funds, dont realize that their stocks are being lent to short sellers, diminishing their true equity return."
1420,"There is no rational basis for a long holder to lend their stock to shorts, as it dilutes the shareholder base &amp; gives the short a strong incentive to attack the company by whatever means possible, including regulators"
1421,I hope to be less wrong over time
1422,Youre most welcome. Hope to do more to help in the future.
1423,What they do should be illegal
1424,The last several years have taught me that they are indeed reasonably maligned
1425,Exactly. Short-sellers are value destroyers. Should definitely be illegal.
1426,"By revenue, taking publicly available selling prices, Model actually outsold Camry by a factor of two"
1427,This is amazing
1428,Almost ready. We expanded the early access program to more users a few days ago.
1429,"People sometimes forget that a company is just a group of people gathered together to make products. So long as it makes great products, it will have great value."
1430,"If you think Tesla is overvalued compared to probable value of future cash flows, sell. Otherwise, buy."
1431,"Hang in there. If you are truly long-term, it will be fine."
1432,True
1433,Sorry about the typo. That was unforgivable. Why would they be upset about their mission? Its what they do.
1434,Just want to that the Shortseller Enrichment Commission is doing incredible work. And the name change is so on point!
1435,Great verdict
1436,Could be worse
1437,"Tesla Autopilot team is awesome! Got to make sure we iron out the details though. Long tail of tricky edge cases. Important to get front wide angle, B pillar &amp; side repeater camera neural nets just right."
1438,Something especially weird going on with Yahoo news feed on iPhone stocks app. Almost always super negative. Maybe getting gamed.
1439,Naughty by Nature
1440,Will do. Definitely moving heavily towards direct to work/home delivery of cars!
1441,Tesla will deliver your car to you. This is the future. The way it should work.
1442,That was intense
1443,i
1444,!! Will take action.
1445,And remember
1446,Huge thank you to all Tesla supporters for helping with car deliveries all around the world. You rock!!
1447,Sorry for difficulties delivering your Tesla due to high volume! Critical to show that environmentally sustainable is financially sustainable.
1448,Pace of innovation is all that matters in the long run
1449,Youre welcome. Sorry for the delay!
1450,What would be great is original Elite
1451,Going over final tweaks tonight. Hopefully in wide release end of week.
1452,Tesla Owners
1453,"Increased tire pressure improves range. Also, if you have performance tires, they are stickier. Better handling, but slightly lower range."
1454,"Apologies, were upgrading our logistics system, but running into an extreme shortage of car carrier trailers. Started building our own car carriers this weekend to alleviate load."
1455,Tricky one
1456,"Wow, thanks for offering to help! The coming week is incredibly intense. If any current Tesla owners whod like to help educate new owners could head to Tesla delivery centers during midday on Sat/Sun &amp; morning/evening on weekdays, that would be super appreciated!"
1457,Probably for a base to be built
1458,Mars Base Alpha
1459,"Consider an ice skater. Same weight, but spins/turns much faster with arms in vs arms out. Same principle is true for a car."
1460,"Front vs rear wheel weight distribution, though commonly asked, isn't the right question. You can have % on front, % on rear &amp; still have poor handling if mass elements are far from center. Dumbbell mass distribution is bad, spinning top/dreidel is good."
1461,Simple explanation of polar moment of inertia &amp; other important car terms at
1462,"Key technical point is that the polar moment of inertia (concentration of mass around center) of a Tesla, to the extent of our knowledge, is better than any other production car. This positively affects safety, handling &amp; driving feel. Extremely important metric."
1463,A car propelled by combustion is far more likely to combust than an electric car
1464,"Yes, when it comes to physics, make sure Newton is on your side"
1465,"Helps improve forward crumple zone length, especially important in high speed frontal impacts, and moments of inertia in side impacts"
1466,Tesla piece on the physics of car safety coming soon for those interested in technical details
1467,"Exactly, all star are *not* the same, as the videos show. star just means a car met a certain threshold, but injury probability stats (real numbers) tell you by how much."
1468,Haha true
1469,. will post final safety probability stats soon. Model has a shot at being safest car ever tested.
1470,"Wow, glad theyre ok!"
1471,Physics can be thought of as the compression algorithms of reality
1472,Tesla Rangers!
1473,"engines, but with room to add more down the road. Kinda have to."
1474,"Yes, if there is no listener, a simulation probably wouldnt spend computing power on sound"
1475,Yes
1476,True
1477,"To conserve computing power, a simulation would only render an object when it is observed"
1478,Youre most welcome! Sorry for the delay.
1479,Will do. Love Reddit.

1482,"Yeah, Starlink should be active by then"
1483,Sorry! So many bots!!
1484,"Moon mission will be livestreamed in high def VR, so itll feel like youre there in real-time minus a few seconds for speed of light"

1494,Probably V10 alpha build
1495,"Yes, albeit a beta version. Will improve with V9.1."
1496,Good news on this front. Tesla engineering rallied &amp; this will be part of V9. Going through final testing now.
1497,Thank you for your trust in the team. Greatly appreciated.
1498,Will be interesting to see how this evolves over time
1499,Will see what we can do. Really need to bring this program to an end while being as fair as possible. Its not sustainable long-term.
1500,Very interesting
1501,"Due to some Tesla owners encountering system issues yesterday, the free Supercharging referral program will be extended until tomorrow night"
1502,This is definitely worth thoughtful debate. What might we do differently to improve human/life happiness?
1503,"Yes, I do"
1504,Top SpaceX priority is and will remain supporting crewed spaceflight and National Security missions

1516,"Sorry, its not really sustainable at volume production &amp; doesnt incent optimal behavior. We probably should have ended this earlier."
1517,Yes
1518,"Yeah, thats our problem. Service &amp; parts supply in general will be the top Tesla priority after we get through the insane car delivery logistics of the next few weeks."
1519,"Outside repair shops are jack of all trades, which means supporting s of makes &amp; models. Tesla collision repair specializes in three. Having all parts in stock &amp; not waiting for insurance approval also make a world of difference."
1520,Goal is for repaired car to be better than before accident. Should always be true if damaged/used parts are correctly replaced with newer parts.
1521,"Exciting to see some Tesla collision repair operations already completing within hrs. Aiming for same day soon, then under an hour."
1522,"Tesla is bringing most collision repairs in-house, as outside firms take weeks to months for repairs, driving Tesla owners (and us) crazy"
1523,True

1542,"No, service will stock all colors"

1560,"The multi-coat colors (pearl white &amp; red) are hardest, red especially, as it has red tint in the clear coat layer itself for depth &amp; complexity"
1561,"Sorry, weve put pretty extreme rules in place for paint &amp; quality in general. If need be, were repainting/replacing entire sections of car or building whole new cars. Got to be done."

1569,"Its coming, I swear"

1577,This is utterly false. Fossil fuel merchants of doubt have been pushing that bs for years. Tesla Gigafactory will be % renewable powered (by Tesla Solar) by end of next year.
1578,"Most people dont realize that the cost of operating an electric vehicle is much lower than a gas car. Electricity is way cheaper than gas plus no oil changes, tune-ups,smog checks &amp; other service costs."
1579,"Most major customers have tried it &amp; love it. Now we need to finish production design &amp; build it, while avoiding dumb mistakes made with Model production system. Wish it wasnt so hard to be less stupid over time"
1580,Maybe
1581,"This was key showstopper for me personally. Couldnt make it happen, even through expert fiduciary SPV, without creating exotic trust structure that would prob not be accepted by regulators. Current rules have good intentions, but make wealth creation harder for small investors."

1623,Great Q&amp;A last night. Thanks for helping make Tesla &amp; SpaceX more secure! Planning to open-source Tesla vehicle security software for free use by other car makers. Extremely important to a safe self-driving future for all.
1624,"Thanks, great feedback. Will be a fun project for Tesla design. Love the idea of adding a special item every few months, so whenever you go into a Tesla store, there is something new &amp; delightful to see."

1641,"Sorry, meant to say same timeframe as hardware"
1642,Yes
1643,Probably to months. Those who order full self-driving get the upgrade at no cost. It isnt needed just for enhanced Autopilot.
1644,Tesla deliveries &amp; AP hardware chart by at MIT
1645,Investor support is confirmed. Only reason why this is not certain is that its contingent on a shareholder vote.
1646,Def no forced sales. Hope all shareholders remain. Will be way smoother &amp; less disruptive as a private company. Ends negative propaganda from shorts.
1647,"Yes, but liquidity events would be limited to every months or so (like SpaceX)"
1648,No change
1649,Shareholders could either to sell at or hold shares &amp; go private
1650,Absolutely. Am super appreciative of Tesla shareholders. Will ensure their prosperity in any scenario.
1651,My hope is *all* current investors remain with Tesla even if were private. Would create special purpose fund enabling anyone to stay with Tesla. Already do this with Fidelitys SpaceX investment.
1652,Yes
1653,I dont have a controlling vote now &amp; wouldnt expect any shareholder to have one if we go private. I wont be selling in either scenario.

1737,Yeah. Never seen it so high ever.
1738,"Wow, thats really awesome. Thank you!"
1739,Haha
1740,"Looks good, but so many details need to be right. Journey back from hypersonic becomes extremely difficult as velocity increases. Altitude is easy, velocity is hard."
1741,Only costs that actually apply to Q3 &amp; beyond will be counted. It would not be correct to apply historical cost savings to current quarter.
1742,Wall Street
1743,Congratulations to all teams in the student competition! To make high-speed pods that can operate in vacuum is very difficult. Was great to meet everyone!

1745,"Yes, Tesla Model S, X &amp; all automatically keep cabin temperature within safe limits even when parked"
1746,Ok

1754,Dont make me bite my thumb at you
1755,For sure
1756,"Btw, is calling &amp; wants its method of execution back. Seriously, what museum do you plan to raid?"
1757,"Yeah, great point. Underground power lines would clear up the skyline, be safer to service, have better uptime &amp; save lives of many birds."
1758,No kidding
1759,"Yes, that will probably be its first use"
1760,"Phew . Yeah, we had a drain block months ago &amp; people are working hard to make Tesla successful. Am honored to work with them. Are you trolling for fun or is it part of a job? What motivates you?"
1761,I apologized. Do you stand by your guillotine statement or not?
1762,"Figuratively, literally or both?"
1763,That has always been our goal
1764,"This chart only shows globally competed commercial launches, not US government missions. Other US refers to Boeing &amp; Lockheed. Their skill at obtaining govt contracts &amp; subsidies vastly exceeds ours."
1765,"Dunno where this bs is coming from. Who knows about the future, but last week we had over S/X and Model *new* net orders."
1766,Definitely. We gave up some grip &amp; width in exchange for range. Would recommend stickier tires &amp; wider on rear for best performance. You might get sec -60 mph or better with optimized rims &amp; tires.
1767,"Wow, someone has really thought about this!"
1768,I wish
1769,"Nonetheless, his actions against me do not justify my actions against him, and for that I apologize to Mr. Unsworth and to the companies I represent as leader. The fault is mine and mine alone."

1771,Good point
1772,I have never donated to a SuperPAC
1773,"Yes, about % of what I donated to , which is a reasonable amount to maintain an open dialogue"
1774,Reports that I am a top donor to GOP are categorically false. I am not a top donor to any political party.
1775,Thank you for fighting climate change. This affects every living creature on Earth.
1776,"That said, I do not actually see the checks (changed that policy today). A nominal annual amount goes out automatically to both parties to maintain dialogue. I have given vastly more to humanitarian causes."
1777,So that they are willing to listen when I call to object about issues that negatively affect humanity
1778,"Thanks Jack. To be clear, I am not a conservative. Am registered independent &amp; politically moderate. Doesnt mean Im moderate about all issues. Humanitarian issues are extremely important to me &amp; I dont understand why they are not important to everyone."
1779,Actually true

1812,So true
1813,The pumps I saw were running v high flow rate all the way from cave . They stopped shortly after boys were rescued &amp; water level rose to roof level all way back to cave . That was great work.
1814,Sounds good
1815,Glad to hear that. Engineering team also getting feedback from the British dive team on how to improve the design for future applications.
1816,It will happen for sure. Damn.
1817,Should drive temp to target. Why fan speed on app?
1818,Lots of fake accounts on Twitter characterized by high following/follower ratio to make it seem like many real people when it isnt. Wonder why.
1819,"Damn, now I want donuts"
1820,Yeah
1821,Good point. Maybe use non-plumbers with work inspected/approved by pros.
1822,"Youre right on both counts. Most houses in Flint have safe water, but theyve lost faith in govt test results. Some houses are still outliers. Will organize a weekend in Flint to add filters to those houses with issues &amp; hopefully fix perception of those that are actually good."
1823,Maybe rewarding to organize a barnstorming weekend for water filter installation?
1824,"For now, reply to my tweet with ppm &amp; ppb test results &amp; will send someone to install a water filter. Creating email flint.com, but Im in China so that wont be working until tomorrow."
1825,Please consider this a commitment that I will fund fixing the water in any house in Flint that has water contamination above FDA levels. No kidding.
1826,Great move
1827,Why sir
1828,Stockholm: its not just a syndrome
1829,Good point
1830,"Definitely. Cant wait to try that. Been a little distracted past few months on mostly Tesla matters, but back at it soon."
1831,"Yes, and springy, like a highly damped trampoline"
1832,Well it looked smaller on paper
1833,"Catching rocket fairings falling from space has proven tricky, so we made the net really big"
1834,"Yes. Caves are now filled with water again. Difficulty of passage is massively dependent on water level. Little kids can walk/swim in when low, but it can be deadly to pro divers when high. Pump &amp; generator engineering team deserves some credit for the rescue."
1835,It sometimes feels like reality is a moral filter. I suppose that is what religion tells us. Wonder what I should do differently.
1836,Makes a lot of sense
1837,This reaction has shaken my opinion of many people. We were asked to create a backup option &amp; worked hard to do so. Checked with dive team many times to confirm it was worthwhile. Now its there for anyone who needs it in future. Somethings messed up if this is not a good thing.
1838,I think the person who attacked me on Twitter will survive somehow
1839,Thanks for correcting me. I meant to say over half a million people.
1840,Please lmk contamination levels of any kind when you test the water
1841,Please lmk results of your water tests
1842,"When youre there next week, are you planning to test water sources for lead?"
1843,Should be very soon. Weve already made around Model Performance cars for test drives in stores.
1844,Exactly
1845,"No, it means I created jobs for people directly and, through parts suppliers &amp; supporting professions, ~250,000 people indirectly, thus supporting half a million families. What have you done?"
1846,Already have
1847,"Ironically, the billionaire label, when used by media, is almost always meant to devalue &amp; denigrate the subject. I wasnt called that until my companies got to a certain size, but reality is that I still do the same science &amp; engineering as before. Just the scale has changed."
1848,"Good for rescuing vulnerable patients in dangerous environments, particularly if water, toxic gas or dangerous bacteria/viruses present, as patient would remain dry &amp; at std air pressure entire time."
1849,"Yes, it was specifically designed to pass that point"
1850,"Moreover, based on extensive cave video review &amp; discussion with several divers who know journey, SpaceX engineering is absolutely certain that mini-sub can do entire journey &amp; demonstrate at any time."
1851,"The former Thai provincial governor (described inaccurately as rescue chief) is not the subject matter expert. That would be Dick Stanton, who co-led the dive rescue team. This is our direct correspondence:"
1852,Great news that they made it out safely. Congratulations to an outstanding rescue team!
1853,Ok
1854,Just returned from Cave . Mini-sub is ready if needed. It is made of rocket parts &amp; named Wild Boar after kids soccer team. Leaving here in case it may be useful in the future. Thailand is so beautiful.
1855,That would be cool. I wonder what its like under all that ice.
1856,A second one that is cm shorter is almost complete
1857,Yes. Those videos are from this morning.
1858,"According to divers who have made the passage, yes. However, we also made an exact replica that is inflatable, so that the entire path can be tested without risk of blockage."
1859,Simulating maneuvering through a narrow passage
1860,"Thanks, but weve not done anything useful yet. It is all other people."
1861,"According to divers who have made the journey, this is capable of maneuvering through all passages"
1862,Tube diameter is cm
1863,"Mini-sub arriving in about hours. Hopefully useful. If not, perhaps it will be in a future situation."
1864,Thanks for letting us use your pool
1865,It is an honor to work with them
1866,"With some mods, this could also work as an escape pod in space"
1867,I want to know who is running the Etherium scambots! Mad skillz
1868,It is both alarming &amp; explanatory that you run a psych ward
1869,"Diver weight belts wrapped around outside. Mini-sub only weighs ~40kg dry, so easy to carry on long dry sections of cave, then add weight belts for wet sections."
1870,"Yeah, that sounds cool. Music makes things better. Calms the mind. Adding padded wall pockets for a hand radio &amp; phone/music player."
1871,"Aluminum shell has high thermal conductivity, so will be close to ambient. If ambient is cold, a thin layer of neoprene insulation around interior will keep occupant warm."
1872,Buoyancy adjusted by strapping diver weight belts around body of capsule. Theyre prevented from sliding off by the diver handhold attachments.
1873,"Testing for more hours in LA, then its on a plane to Thailand"
1874,"Design based on dive team feedback (primarily Stanton): air / oxygen ports front &amp; rear, front ports protected by nosecone. Dual O-ring seal on acrylic rear plate with clear view of occupant head. Leak/buckling proof to X cave water pressure."
1875,I am an engineer
1876,Tight control code is always C
1877,Python is done right. Great name story too.
1878,"If I am a narcissist (which might be true), at least I am a useful one"
1879,Python
1880,Pretty close. There is a nosecone on the front to protect against rocks impacting fwd air hoses with a hole on the side for hoses to exit.
1881,Turbo
1882,C
1883,"Given Chiang Rai airport hours, soonest we couldve departed US was an hour ago, but cave now closed for diver rescue. Will continue testing in LA in case needed later or for somewhere else in future."
1884,"Will do. Even if not useful here, perhaps it will be in a future situation."
1885,Extremely talented dive team. Makes sense given monsoon. Godspeed.
1886,Yes
1887,Yes
1888,Fitted for a kid or small adult to minimize open air. Segmented compartments to place rocks or dive weights &amp; adjust bouyancy.
1889,Yes
1890,"handles/hitch points on front &amp; on rear. air tank connections on front &amp; on rear, allowing to tanks simultaneously connected, all recessed for impact protection w secondary cap seal if leak develops."
1891,Im in LA working with the SpaceX team building the kid mini-sub
1892,"Construction complete in about hours, then hour flight to Thailand"
1893,"Continue to be amazed by the bravery, resilience &amp; tenacity of kids &amp; diving team in Thailand. Human character at its best."
1894,"Got more great feedback from Thailand. Primary path is basically a tiny, kid-size submarine using the liquid oxygen transfer tube of Falcon rocket as hull. Light enough to be carried by divers, small enough to get through narrow gaps. Extremely robust."
1895,Ground winds would
1896,Yes. All-weather. ~300km/h high altitude winds. ~60km/h ground winds. Its a beast.
1897,Cant be too buoyant
1898,"Some good feedback from cave experts in Thailand. Iterating with them on an escape pod design that might be safe enough to try. Also building an inflatable tube with airlocks. Less likely to work, given tricky contours, but great if it does."
1899,Good idea
1900,"Prob wise to add an air tank (butt end fwd to take impacts) in nose of pod &amp; vent valve in rear. Set air tank to slow bleed rate, then no need for SCUBA mouthpiece or regulator. Training unnecessary &amp; less susceptible to panic attack."
1901,Youre welcome. Happy birthday!
1902,"Yeah, thats what Im talking about in that tweet double-layer Kevlar pressure pod with Teflon coating. Other approach is a long inflatable air sock. Both worth trying."
1903,Exactly. You can put socks on your feet the same way. There would be no relative motion between the tube &amp; rock wall.
1904,Its open so that others who are closer to the problem can consider this as one possible solution
1905,"Should be possible to increase the air inflow rate above the leak rate, unless there is a very big hole. If oxygen % is dropping, suggests that leak holes are not large."
1906,I would def recommend this
1907,Building double-layer Kevlar pressure pods with Teflon coating to slip by rocks &amp; front/rear rope tow hitch &amp; lead pockets for neutral buoyancy. ~60 cm oval. Testing this aft in a pool with a subject who has never done SCUBA. Do the divers think something like this might work?
1908,Interesting
1909,"Great, thanks"
1910,Inflatable tubes &amp; pods being made out of Kevlar for better abrasion resistance. A SpaceX engineer happens to be in Thailand &amp; is headed there now. Could one of the divers DM me? Need approx contour of most difficult sections for tube fab.
1911,"So long as air pressure in tube higher than water pressure, air will blow out &amp; water wont come in"
1912,"Does you know output voltage &amp; amperage of those generator trucks? phase? What frequency? Will need high voltage transformer to carry power over distance or very thick cable. Beyond that, only batteries will work. Will prep Powerwalls in case needed."
1913,SpaceX &amp; Boring Co engineers headed to Thailand tomorrow to see if we can be helpful to govt. There are probably many complexities that are hard to appreciate without being there in person.
1914,"Looks like st bit of water is close enough to entrance to be pumped out. nd &amp; rd would need battery packs, air pumps &amp; tubes. If depth of nd is accurate, would need ~0.5 bar tube pressure. Prob need to enter tube, zip up &amp; then transit."
1915,"So long as air feed rate exceeds leak rate, tube remains inflated. This is how bouncy castles or inflatable mazes work. Needs very little power as the work (physics def of work) done is low. Pumping out water faster than it enters the cave system is prob X to X more power."
1916,Have a small velcro slit entrance &amp; exit in circumferential direction (half stress of longitudinal direction)
1917,"Walking speed is around km/h, but if youre in an air tube, time doesnt matter much. If tube diameter was m, a fast walk of km would take mins or so. Just need to duck for the narrow sections."
1918,Maybe worth trying: insert a m diameter nylon tube (or shorter set of tubes for most difficult sections) through cave network &amp; inflate with air like a bouncy castle. Should create an air tunnel underwater against cave roof &amp; auto-conform to odd shapes like the cm hole.
1919,Exactly. A journalist who publicly expresses love for &amp; parties in Vegas with a prominent shortseller of any given company should disclose this when writing articles.
1920,"I know you &amp; believe you, but it means Lopez misled readers in her article, because that is exactly what she said"
1921,I didnt ask anyone and the people who sent the snapshots dont work for me. They just dont like hypocrites.
1922,They were sent to me by multiple people on the Internet. I dont use Facebook.
1923,Lopez wrote that Melissa Lee of CNBC was dancing her face off with Chanos in Vegas. Is this true?
1924,Why did publish a love letter puff piece about Chanoss cuff links? Who took the pic? Obv not objective
1925,. posted on social media that she was partying in Vegas with Chanos &amp; Tepper with caption Love both these dudes. Doesnt sound very objective
1926,"Norwegians are right to be upset with Tesla. We are having trouble expanding our service facilities in Oslo especially. Can solve quickly with Tesla mobile service vans, but awaiting govt permission to do so."
1927,Are you % certain that stands by &amp; supports everything shes done? Why wont Lopez go on record saying that she never offered Tripp anything for inside info or asked him to break his confidentiality agreement by taking detailed video of Tesla IP?
1928,Sounds fishy. How did that go down?
1929,True
1930,"So publicly stated she stans for Chanos, Teslas most prominent short-seller. In her words, he is one of the greatest. Her articles print Chanoss view verbatim. This is not journalism."
1931,". You stated publicly that you see eye to eye with Chanos, the most prominent short-seller of Tesla. Have you ever provided him with material non-public information about Tesla?"
1932,What a coincidence
1933,Am not attacking all media or even all of . Just asked if you inform public about an analysts prediction track record about a subject when putting them on your show.
1934,"Indeed, very simple question. To be specific: , did you compensate or promise to compensate Martin Tripp for inside information about Tesla? Did he, under that inducement, provide you with exaggerated negative info, which you printed, but turned out to be untrue?"
1935,"Exactly. , I just asked a simple question. Please answer."
1936,"Strange. , is it true that you are putting on analysts with such low ratings &amp; extremely bad prediction records? Are your viewers informed about an analysts track record before hearing their opinion."
1937,"Note, no one is in the car or controlling remotely. Car is driving entirely by itself."
1938,"Sounds very sketchy if true. , is it possible youre serving as an inside trading source for one of Teslas biggest short-sellers? An ex-Tesla employee just went on record formally claiming you bribed him &amp; he sent you valuable Tesla IP in exchange. Is this true?"
1939,"has published several false articles about Tesla, including a doozy where she claimed Tesla scrapped more batteries than our total S,X &amp;3 production number, which is physically impossible."
1940,"Wow, so of wrote article that misled public about Model production &amp; followed that up with mean tweet to me on my bday. Nice work &amp; ."
1941,"., why did you mislead the people public about this number?"
1942,". is relentlessly negative about Tesla. They just wrote a bogus article saying S production last week was low by cars. S/X annual prod is set at ~100k, ie /week. Tesla built S/X cars at our standard ~50/50 split last week, which is right on target."
1943,Happy to support
1944,"Boring Co has advanced ground penetrating radar &amp; is pretty good at digging holes. Dont know if pump rate is limited by electric power or pumps are too smal. If so, could dropship fully charged Powerpacks and pumps."
1945,Belfast is beautiful
1946,"No, was just there with my kids for a few hours to see the GoT set &amp; had dinner at a pub. Love the show and GRRMs books."
1947,Should be coming soon

2014,"Virtue signaling is super annoying &amp; there are lots of phoneys who are actually huge jerks, but jump on every social cause du jour. But Im really proud of the fact that of changes Tesla had to make to achieve /100 (before even knowing about the LGBTQ index) was zero."
2015,Dont buy our car if thats a problem. People should be free to live their lives where their heart takes them
2016,Then you will really hate that Tesla scored /100 four years in a row on LGBTQ equality
2017,We must aspire to truth
2018,Important to read the Wash Post article. The unable to account for number does not refer to actual lost children. It refers to calls not answered or returned in a day period.
2019,Hopefully in V9.0 release in a few months
2020,True
2021,"We should always be concerned about the welfare of children &amp; those who cannot protect themselves, wherever they may be, but it seems much of the reporting on this issue has been partisan &amp; often inaccurate"
2022,"of the children, remained where they were placed, had moved, had run away and five were deported. That left migrant children. Just because their parents or guardians did not return HHSs phone calls after days does not mean the children are missing"
2023,"All children were resettled by HHS. After days, the department called the parents or guardians to check up on things. But these calls were not required by law, and in cases, the parents or guardians did not respond"

2095,"Hes obv wrong. Forcing function for any % mkt share monopolist to improve is weak &amp; a national govt is that by fiat. One may find lowish correlation for negativity, but that does not mean low causation."
2096,Great name. A little on the nose.
2097,"Thats really decision about how good you think govt is at allocating capital. Buffett, for example, is vastly better than any govt at allocating capital. Consumption vs capital allocation extremely misunderstood. Biggest missing piece in public understanding of what money is."
2098,"Yeah, all-inclusive tax rate of % seems about right. Below % is unrealistic for critical govt functions unless national defense is de facto outsourced &amp; above % too negatively affects economic output."

2134,You wont find pro-union either. The books are all about freedom. No one is forced to join any organization.
2135,"Thanks, good advice"
2136,They have about three weeks before their short position explodes
2137,Good points. Already mostly working in the developer software Im driving.
2138,Cant wait for the new season to start!
2139,"Weve always provided healthcare, hourly wages above union &amp; Tesla stock. Also, free drinks &amp; snacks. Try to make it fun too. Top ten hourly workers cumulatively received Tesla stock now worth $1M to $2M. Nobody wants UAW, so UAW keeps trashing Tesla &amp; me via rd parties."
2140,Glad you teach physics. That and critical thinking (ie how not to be tricked) are foundational for all kids to learn.
2141,"Yeah, I think we pretty much agree. Btw, great show."
2142,"I think essential services, incl health care, should be taken care of by govt/taxpayers (socialist) &amp; other parts of economy should be served by companies competing to serve the people (capitalist). Aka, the view held by most of America."
2143,They started it &amp; attacked me personally
2144,Search UAW and corruption. Very long reading list. Great organization.
2145,Profit just means you earned more money than you spent &amp; certainly does spark innovation. Jesus. This is obv a good thing &amp; extremely hard. It has taken Tesla years &amp; were almost there. Every other US car company besides Ford &amp; Tesla has gone bankrupt.
2146,They dont seem to think much or care about the future beyond a narrow horizon
2147,Engels wrote nd &amp; rd volumes based on Marxs notes. Less reliable.
2148,"Wanted to help transition the world to sustainable, clean energy and extend life as we know it beyond Earth. Those problems require a lot of hardware."
2149,"Wow, you know nothing &amp; are worthy of contempt. The world is under massive attack due to climate change &amp; you couldnt care less."

2153,"Youre just a troll/bot, but I will reply anyway. I arrived in Montreal at by myself with $2k. No support, no contacts, nothing. Father said Id fail &amp; be back in months."
2154,"I dont want to see anyone lose their money. Or I will at least provide fair warning before it happens, as I have done in the past."
2155,You think all companies are bad and all unions good? Thats a very bigoted position.
2156,Well said
2157,Then youll be fine
2158,Exactly. Our NDA is actually shorter &amp; simpler than most.
2159,"...which clearly doesnt work. UAW and Wall Street shorts know every detail of whats happening at Tesla. Storm clouds are gathering, so theyre getting desperate."
2160,"Then look a little closer, doctorow. Read the whole thread."
2161,More propaganda. The NDA only prevents disclosure of Tesla proprietary IP or material non-public information (insider trading).
2162,How big is your short position? Just curious.
2163,Union flyers are handed out all the time in the factory. I know because people in the factory laugh at the ridiculous propaganda &amp; hand them to me. This one guys claim about being stopped once in a parking lot is false and irrelevant.
2164,"I endorse freedom to form a union too, as well as freedom not to do so if they feel Tesla is a good company. UAW has major conflicts of interest &amp; failed our car plant already when they abandoned us in . Tesla can only hire % of applicants, so must be doing something right."
2165,"UAW doesnt have % of signatures (about people) needed for a vote. They cant even muster enough people for a free bbq. Instead, theyre getting paid trolls &amp; far left shills to trash Tesla &amp; me in press &amp; social media. Such creeps."
2166,"Im not against all unions, but UAW has a track record of destroying productivity so a company cant compete on world market. Our current factory went bankrupt under UAW before we took it over. Dont want Tesla to die too."
2167,"I am too, of sorts. Govt (ie other taxpayers) should take care of critical needs of people, incl defense, judiciary, health care, etc. Rest should be companies competing to provide best product or service to the people."
2168,"Was originally called Puff the Magic Dragon, as people said I was high if though it could work, so I named it after their insult."
2169,"Iain certainly wasnt pro-union in the Culture books. At all. And wouldnt be in the case of Tesla. Banks was about freedom through &amp; through. Maybe for a single buyer (monopsony) vs single seller (monopoly), I would be too, but thats a special case."
2170,"SX &amp; soon SX . Kind of a modern version of Inconel superalloys. High strength at temperature, extreme oxidation resistance. Needed for ~800 atmosphere, hot, oxygen-rich turbopump on Raptor rocket engine."

2172,Love you too
2173,Fair point
2174,"Auto-semiotic asphyxiation (sorry, couldnt resist)"
2175,And I dont trust that Engels guy. He could have made up most of nd &amp; rd volumes. Nobody actually knows.
2176,Your math isnt very good. Would require %. And whats your issue anyway? Better suggestions are welcome.

2186,"If you must know, I am a utopian anarchist of the kind best described by Iain Banks"
2187,I disagree with that goal &amp; gave away Tesla patents to help other companies
2188,"If Im not a communist, why do I make red cars"
2189,"Very appealing if youre a sophomore in college. Its a counterpoint to communism and useful as such, but should be tempered with kindness."
2190,That is why it is critical to support competition. Excess profits draw in competitors who then drive down prices.
2191,lol
2192,"Read Das Kapital when I was , incl cross-checking English translation of original German. Adam Smith FTW obv. Ironically, future automation will naturally lead to greater equality of consumption. Monopolies are true enemy of people. Competing to serve is good."
2193,Might actually be his!
2194,Amazing work by Tesla team. Built entire new general assembly line in weeks w minimal resources. Love u guys so much! Pic of st Model dual motor performance coming off the line
2195,Youre a docile puppet of the UAW. Be honest about what you are.
2196,Yes
2197,Sigh
2198,"By the way, I am actually a socialist. Just not the kind that shifts resources from most productive to least productive, pretending to do good, while actually causing harm. True socialism seeks greatest good for all."
2199,No sense of humor is certainly proving itself true. Good grief! How many socialists does it take to screw in a lightbulb? Answer: Thats not funny!!

2203,No
2204,My father has no money. Only reason he even has a house is because my brother &amp; I bought it for him on condition that he not cause harm to others. That obviously failed.
2205,"There is considerable confusion between wealth as consumption &amp; wealth as labor allocation. By latter measure, anyone in govt whose budget exceeds $1B is a billionaire. Government is the largest corporation."
2206,Socialism vs capitalism is not even the right question. What really matters is avoiding monopolies that restrict peoples freedom.
2207,Universal income will be necessary over time if AI takes over most human jobs
2208,Marx was a capitalist. He even wrote a book about it.

2211,What is yours?
2212,What is your utopia?
2213,The future is a set of branching probability streams. Some actions by humanity have an extremely leveraged effect on shape &amp; size of those streams.
2214,Strongly disagree. I love humanity.
2215,"Already did. Meant to go longer, but ran out of time."
2216,I always wanted to do a terms &amp; conditions cover of Green Eggs &amp; Ham
2217,Foundation Series &amp; Zeroth Law are fundamental to creation of SpaceX
2218,I love Banks. Best books in recent years imo are Iain Banks &amp; George Martin.
2219,"Given how bad I am at poetry, probably Vogon"
2220,Should prob articulate philosophy underlying my actions. Its pretty simple &amp; mostly influenced by Douglas Adams &amp; Isaac Asimov.
2221,My donations are anonymous
2222,Already sold &gt;$100M TSLA for charity. Will do about that every few years. Major disbursements in about years when Tesla is steady state.
2223,"My pay is in options, which only matter if stock goes up &amp; I sell. Will use that to make life multiplanetary, help education &amp; environment on Earth w my foundation. Just dont want us to be sad about the future."

2228,"Some very, very tough calls. Had to let go of good people, but I think they will find new jobs quickly."
2229,"Difficult, but necessary Tesla reorg underway. My email to the company has already leaked to media. Here it is unfiltered:"
2230,That is actual footage
2231,Back in the Precambrian era when the main form of life was a sponge
2232,Thanks! Have heard universally great things about your podcasts.
2233,"Of course, but its the kind of hustle that you like even with full knowledge. People can obv read the Internet &amp; anyone who wants a refund will get one. I predict basically zero. The honest-to-goodness fun value is amazing &amp; were never going to make them again."
2234,"Trade is just that Roadster becomes a seater instead of a +2. COPV in place of the kid seats, which is prob wise for many reasons"
2235,"Exactly. Total energy stored even in ultra compressed air is low vs battery, but power output is insane. The composite overwrapped pressure vessel (COPV) is most advanced ever made. Its what SpaceX is qualifying for NASA crewed missions. Extremely robust literally bulletproof."
2236,Not recommended for urban environments
2237,Yes
2238,"The actual amount of time I spend on Twitter is tiny. My tweets are literally what Im thinking at the moment, not carefully crafted corporate bs, which is really just banal propaganda."
2239,It is amazingly hard to find a simple solution. A complicated one is relatively easy.
2240,Love this design. Simpler the better.
2241,Add an R for Roadster
2242,"Sigh. This is crux of matter: cant make system too annoying or people wont use it, negatively affecting safety, but also cant allow people to get too complacent or safety again suffers. Latest update should have a positive effect on latter issue especially."
2243,A lot of people whose judgment I respect have suggested this. Sounds like a good idea. Will do so after Model production reaches k/week steady.
2244,"Yes. Hopefully, Im not tempting fate too much with that date. It was meant as a joke, but is about the right actual timing."
2245,Will do
2246,"Correct, pure electric. Wish orbital rockets could be so too, but theres no escaping Newtons Third Law. SpaceX is already developing high efficiency CO2 capture with H2O to form liquid CH4 (methane) &amp; O2. Critical for propellant production at Mars Base Alpha."
2247,"You have my word, Marques. Next gen Roadster will be absolutely out of this world. For those who love to drive, there is no finer car in history and we dont think there will be another."
2248,"Note, gas contained would be ultra high pressure air in a SpaceX rocket COPV bottle. The air exiting the thrusters would immediately be replenished whenever vehicle pack power draw allowed operation of the air pump, which is most of the time."
2249,"Intent of new Tesla Roadster is to beat gas sports cars on every performance metric by far, no exceptions, thus transferring the halo crown effect gas cars have as the top speed leaders over to pure electric."
2250,"That issue is better in latest Autopilot software rolling out now &amp; fully fixed in August update as part of our long-awaited Tesla Version . To date, Autopilot resources have rightly focused entirely on safety. With V9, we will begin to enable full self-driving features."
2251,"This is why Im not impressed when reporters who were literally in junior high while I was in newsrooms all round the world say that if I only knew how newsrooms really worked, then Id know everythings fine &amp; no need for a media credibility rating system like Pravduh"
2252,"Zip2 also built a newspaper publishing platform that brought hundreds of regional &amp; city papers online for the first time, and made major functionality advancements to the NY Times, Boston Globe &amp; Knight-Ridder websites. NYT, KR &amp; Hearst were all major investors in Zip2."
2253,years of intense programming on extremely weak CPUs with nothing for memory &amp; a straw for bandwidth tends to burn itself onto your like a branding iron. Can still remember trying to squeeze fractions of a millisecond out of the /?}%$&amp; fetch_joystick_state function.
2254,"In early s, I wrote a multitasker for PCs that spoofed the CPU &amp; CD-ROM to act in parallel, so could read video continuously while player sprite moved smoothly. Required C++, assembly &amp; direct flipping of CPU registers. That companys name was Rocket Science. Fate loves irony."
2255,"Thats quite a blast from the past! After my Zip2 experience w patents, I felt that patents (particularly software) inhibited innovation, instead of fostering it. I aspired to file zero patents after that. In , we open-sourced all Tesla patents"
2256,"At Zip2, I wrote entire V1 of software for drawing vector maps &amp; calculating point to point directions anywhere in US (first ever company to do so), as well as white pages &amp; business listings w reviews (an early Yelp). Also wrote V1 of classifieds, autotrading &amp; real estate apps."
2257,"More background: I arrived in North America at w $2000, a backpack &amp; a suitcase full of books. Paid my own way thru college. Dropped out of Stanford Eng/Phys grad school w $110k in college debt. Created Internet startup w bro &amp; Greg Khouri (love bro &amp; loved Greg, may he RIP)"
2258,"We dont think our product will be the cause of any wildfires, but The Boring Company is donating $10k."
2259,"Using the config you describe, plus an electric pump to replenish air in COPV, when car power draw drops below max pack power output, makes sense. But we are going to go a lot further."
2260,"years ago, when my st company got bought, I had to decide between buying a house in Palo Alto or a McLaren F1 (best car ever imo). Was no contest. I bought F1 &amp; a small condo that was much cheaper than the car. New Tesla Roadster will exceed all gas sports cars in every way"
2261,"SpaceX option package for new Tesla Roadster will include ~10 small rocket thrusters arranged seamlessly around car. These rocket engines dramatically improve acceleration, top speed, braking &amp; cornering. Maybe they will even allow a Tesla to fly"
2262,"Terms &amp; conditions for Not-a-Flamethrower Please use as directed to avoid unintentionally burning things down. For simple &amp; concise instructions, we drew upon wisdom in great Dr Seuss book Green Eggs and Ham."
2263,"Almost forgot! Due to recent regulatory/customs rules enacted to inhibit transport of anything called a Flamethrower, we have renamed our product: Not a Flamethrower."
2264,Yes
2265,Each flamethrower comes with a state-of-the-art The Boring Company brand fire extinguisher. Will offer a TBC ice blaster before the dry season starts in winter.
2266,"Flamethrower obv best way to light your fireplace/BBQ. No more need to use a dainty match to ignite! If no wood, just drop your flamethrower in fire place! It will generate way more warmth than a quaint pile of logs."
2267,Coming soon
2268,I think so
2269,Nothing makes your baby more zen than a few gentle puffs of a TBC Flamethrower
2270,First Boring Company Flamethrowers being picked up today!
2271,Were building out Tesla body repair in all major metro areas to ensure super fast &amp; excellent outcome
2272,Talked with Tesla team. Looks like we can do the aluminum Model pedal covers (slightly different from S). Turning on production for Model Performance version.
2273,Gigafactory should be on % renewable energy (primarily solar with some wind) by next year. Rollout of solar already begun.
2274,"Yeah, actually closer to Skylab, but with % larger inner diameter"
2275,And were definitely going to have a pod bay door override button. Lesson learned.
2276,"Definitely. Will also have Augmented Mode that will massively enhance human driving ability. Like a flying metal suit, but in car form"
2277,Running track in BF Spaceship will look something like this
2278,"No plans for aluminum pedals. Adds too much production complexity. Model will def have summon, which will get way more advanced for S &amp; X w HW2 Autopilot &amp; all Model cars."
2279,Working on improving
2280,"No way mins is enough for abs. I mean, come on, mins is obv right."
2281,"Oh please, thats obv overkill"
2282,Tip of the day
2283,Coming soon

2289,We have about projects underway in Puerto Rico
2290,Appreciated on behalf of Tesla team
2291,You should get an invite to configure in next few days
2292,Definitely
2293,"Leasing negatively effects Tesla cash flow, so we prob wont offer Model leases for to months. Loan financing is a better deal anyway, as bank conservatism for new car models is v conservative about residual value, but Teslas have always had strong residual value."
2294,Model Performance order page progressively rolling out to reservation holders over the next week or so. Its a really great car. Not saying that lightly. Test drive is a mindwarp. Aiming to have these as our first test drive Model cars in stores within to weeks.
2295,Next year
2296,Twitter is so dark
2297,No no
2298,That is horrifying

2304,"Usually, they dont even realize it. All they know is that some PR agency is pushing a story that will get clicks. That is the true nature of the corruption. It is rare that US media knowingly writes a false story just for clicks, but they are often manipulated into doing so."
2305,Actually true!
2306,"Singapore has enough land area to generate most of its electricity from the sun. Solar energy is more than most people realize. MW per sq km at current commercial efficiency solar panels. No more need to import fossil fuels for electricity, which is a strategic vulnerability."
2307,"But dont worry, cars have been tested for emissions levels &amp; everythings just fine"
2308,"Why have policies that promote a combustion vehicle fleet in a dense city environment? In bumper to bumper traffic, each cars exhaust pipes releases poison gases right into the air intake of car behind. This is not healthy."
2309,The results speak for themselves. Singapore is a very prosperous city and yet has very few electric cars.
2310,Glad youre ok!
2311,Some details on the Tesla air filtration system
2312,Mid for RHD
2313,That sounds like a fun adventure!
2314,You can just take the aero inserts out of the standard wheel &amp; it looks pretty cool. We could offer that as an option at purchase.
2315,"Model should be second best in world after Model S/X. Still super good, but we went a little on S/X."
2316,"Filters bacteria, viruses, spores, pollen &amp; particulate of almost any kind"
2317,"Model S &amp; X also have an acid gas filter, an alkaline gas filter &amp; a carbon monoxide detector that autoswitches car to recirc mode. We should prob tell people about this more. Filters are giant, so too big to fit in Model ."

2325,Finders keepers
2326,Hi !
2327,Try adjusting tire pressure. Will ask Tesla engineering to investigate.
2328,Hell of a week
2329,Just for perspective
2330,"True, no one is perfect"
2331,Youre most welcome. More to come in this regard.
2332,"Tesla will always refute articles that are misleading &amp; point out if there is someone with a pattern of doing so. Many fit this description, but Consumer Reports is always fair &amp; accurate in their criticism."
2333,"Ride comfort &amp; aero/road noise already better than CR car, which was early production. Wish we could make the car perfect from day , but theres always room for improvement. Highly recommend dropping tire pressure % below max to ~39 psi for comfort. Only affects range by ~2%."
2334,Prob
2335,Yes
2336,"All items below will go to all Model s within next few months with V8.2 software. To report a bug or ask for a feature, press voice button, say bug report followed by issue description."
2337,Pneumatic means propelled by air. Opposite of Hyperloop.
2338,"Braking &amp; UI upgrades apply to all Model s. Improved windshield for aero noise &amp; suspension for ride comfort are major ops. Unless youre really bothered by them, dont replace. Best way to improve ride is drop tire pressure to ~39 psi. psi is best range, but lower comfort."
2339,"Yeah, absolutely"
2340,Really appreciate the high quality critical feedback from . Road noise &amp; ride comfort already addressed too. UI improvements coming via remote software update later this month.
2341,Like you guys too
2342,"Actually, Hyperloop draws a near vacuum in tube &amp; each pod is powered w electric motors. It is opposite of pneumatically powered."
2343,"Would love to be in India. Some challenging government regulations, unfortunately. Deepak Ahuja, our CFO, is from India. Tesla will be there as soon as he believes we should."
2344,Good progress. Really proud of this design &amp; SpaceX propulsion team. This engine is something special.
2345,Peace
2346,Love the space cowboy esthetic
2347,"At risk of stating the extremely obvious, I am against threats of violence &amp; abusive epithets in any forum. Please do not use them in my name or at all."
2348,"Youre saying a BBC reporter who attacked me for months w unprofessional language &amp; ad hominem attacks, then deleted those tweets to hide them, is a good person?"
2349,This journalist has been attacking me for months incl using genitalia language that she now says is sexist. What a hypocrite!
2350,"Nano is a unit of measure, not a field imo. Wouldve been sexist *not* to express an opinion simply because someone is a woman."
2351,"Hello, have you met the Internet? Everyone gets harassed regardless of gender, especially if they say false things. Saying Im against science is like saying Beyonc doesnt know beats. Blowback from latter (all genders) would make my comment stream seem like Socratic dialogue."
2352,"Gaiman, did you actually read my tweets? I didnt set anyone on anyone. A BBC science reporter tweeted that I was anti-science &amp; I said that was false. Are you saying I dont have the right to deny false accusations? Thats messed up."
2353,"Youve done something incredibly dishonest by supporting a journo who falsely stated that Im against science, then cherrypicked tweets that dont represent the vast majority of my followers to make false claims against them too"
2354,Great book. Read it when it came out.
2355,Exactly
2356,SpaceX has Area at Cape Canaveral. Thats better than .
2357,Yeah
2358,Second best answer to the Fermi Paradox after the simulation argument

2360,Yes
2361,"There are no aliens. Officially, at least"
2362,You have so many great pics &amp; factoids!
2363,"Yes, AWD P first and then AWD. Production costs are always high when line first gets going, so we have to sell higher price versions first or each car will have very negative margins. As production efficiency rises, we can make lower cost versions &amp; not lose money."
2364,I really want to make this cupholder
2365,"A dream that wd prob be a nightmare in reality. Cup holder that auto adjusted for size &amp; stiffness of cup/bottle, maintained cold or hot temp &amp; dried off water condensation. Or I cd work on getting humanity to Mars. Tough choice."
2366,Ive literally had dreams about cup holder designs
2367,Noted. We can prob adjust spring force &amp; catch to be less sensitive. Cupholders are amazingly hard to get right!
2368,Youre welcome. Appreciate the letter.
2369,Good school
2370,Had a great time with my kids
2371,Yes
2372,"Seems to be glitch where tweet to which I replied isnt showing up, removing context. A journo said polls are meaningless because controlled by powerful people &amp; my response was that powerful people also own media. Thus, if you discount polls, you should also discount media."
2373,Thanks
2374,Superchargers will ultimately cover the entire region
2375,"Pointing out to aspiring journo &amp; Rodin spokesmodel, Josh Top, who thinks public polls are controlled by powerful people that the media is *owned* by same. Anyone who thought this was anti-Semitic is just revealing their inner bigot. The context is very clear."
2376,Thanks for offering to help. I will check with my team.
2377,Youre right. These guys can buzzkill themselves (pun intended). Signing off
2378,Who do you think *owns* the press? Hello.
2379,Youre missing the point &amp; living in a bubble of self-righteous sanctimony. The public doesnt trust you. This was true *before* the last election &amp; only got worse. Dont believe me? Run your own poll
2380,"Youre welcome to come by SpaceX, but please stop assuming Im against all journalists. This is not true. Something needs to be done to improve public trust in media."
2381,You really think I havent spent time in a newsroom? Ive spent time in too many. Bleak.
2382,"Sadly, it had better critical analysis than most non-cult media"
2383,"Yup, deleted"
2384,? It should
2385,"No, but dual motors mean increased regen braking &amp; will ride tire traction limit. You wont notice sport brakes unless youre on a racetrack &amp; have the sticky tires."
2386,"Also, firmware fix for upgraded brake performance on standard Model started rolling out yesterday. Should improve braking distance by ~20 ft for repeated heavy braking events. Thanks for excellent critical feedback!"
2387,"Yes, Model Performance will have red calipers &amp; sport level brakes"
2388,Keyword future

2401,USAToday FTW!
2402,Dank is wack unless youre on weed
2403,"Exactly. And NYT could have anyone post an Op Ed. Why, of all people, are they choosing to publish this non-journalist who is also pro gasoline cars? Is this just published as counterpoint? I assume NYT does believe in climate change?"
2404,But femtotech is the future
2405,Nanotech is so . Picotech is times better.
2406,"Yeah, thats exactly right. But after suggesting public critique, I was stunned to see the level of contempt many in media have for their readers. This is way worse than I thought."
2407,The arguments journos are using against the public are word for word the same arguments despots use against democracy
2408,Well said. NYT journo is outraged that dumb public wd dare critique him while attacking me for being sensitive to criticism. Uhh...
2409,A Tesla has a usable reserve of to miles range even after the battery reads empty. This will not hurt the pack.
2410,"Pretty good. TinTin A &amp; B are both closing the link to ground w phased array at high bandwidth, low latency (25 ms). Good enough to play fast response video games."
2411,"Its cool for kids &amp; if used in a fun way, but if you called yourself a rocket scientist in aerospace, they would think youre"
2412,I just sent a note to Tesla service to take care of your car right away &amp; our HVAC engineering lead to fix root cause
2413,Does the psych ward know you smuggled in a mobile phone?
2414,The pain will end
2415,"Wow, amazing Tesla hypermile drive happening"
2416,Gwynne has been prez of SpaceX for years &amp; well-deserved
2417,"Stop trying to charm me. It wont work. Ok, maybe a little Are you a real person or a bot?"
2418,"Using rocket science non-ironically in a bio is never a good sign, especially if you work on"
2419,What are you talking about? Youre being incredibly rude &amp; nonsensical.
2420,"Wow, havent watched that video in ages. When we made that, no one in the space industry thought it would actually happen."
2421,"Generally higher quality reporting, especially if not under pressure to publish fast. Consumer Reports is great (and often critical of Tesla). Heard good things about The Information too."
2422,Cant believe someone leaked this schematic of the Tesla production system!!
2423,"We tried, but Singapore govt is not supportive of electric vehicles"
2424,Tesla will start extending the Supercharger network to South America around end of next year
2425,Prob end of next year
2426,"Good point, we will add that to the construction plan"
2427,"Global map of Tesla Superchargers, including those coming soon"
2428,"Earths rotation is slowly, slowly, slowly getting slower"
2429,Youre making my point. Its tragic that theres a national nano day. I wish I didnt know that.
2430,All four. Zone throughput was solved a couple of weeks ago.
2431,Model was designed for min engineering &amp; tooling change for RHD. Note left/right symmetry. LHD for Europe &amp; Asia first half of next year. RHD probably middle of next year.
2432,This is the new production line for battery module Zone . Will play a key role in getting from /week to /week for Model .
2433,I have never attacked science. Definitely attacked misleading journalism like yours though.
2434,"Pravda was incorporated a year ago. Also, Tesla factory safety has improved every year &amp; is now better than industry avg. Misleading articles refer to Tesla being worse than avg in when we were just figuring things out."
2435,Worth a shot
2436,Of course! (Prav)Duh. It is named after the most pernicious propaganda machine in history specifically to highlight what we want to avoid. Its called satire
2437,"This is going to help journalism, not harm it. Please be so kind as to hold your fire until you actually see it."
2438,"Problem solved, was able to buy ! Game on"
2439,"I know, I know. Russia seriously didnt correct me on this!"
2440,"Something needs to be done to reward consistent, high quality journalism. Some in media are absurdly indignant before even seeing the product. Odd"
2441,"Turns out is actually owned by Ukraine. For some reason, Russia didnt bother to correct me"
2442,"For some reason, Russia didnt bother to correct me"
2443,"Tried to buy , but Russia said no. Turns out they already use it."
2444,"Definitely did not. Ive been through many press cycles &amp; know full well same person praising me today will trash me tomorrow. Journos hound me constantly for interviews, but I do almost none these days. Twitter as it allows me to bypass journo bs."
2445,Ive just had it with sanctimonious journalists who appoint themselves protectors of the public interest &amp; yet believe that same public is too stupid &amp; immoral to assess their credibility. Its amazing that you dont understand how insufferably hypocritical that is. Wow.
2446,The Tesla facility is open plan &amp; were not going to erect walls everywhere for a journo tour. I know journalists too well &amp; they are some of the worst &amp; best human beings Ive ever met. Youre the former.
2447,No
2448,Nano applies to everything &amp; therefore means nothing. Definitely indicates bs. Sorry.
2449,"Yes, because Tesla has the most advanced battery manufacturing technology in the world &amp; products that havent been unveiled yet. You dont have a right to show that to our competitors or spoil future product launches."
2450,"Wow, youre ignorant. Dont remember you, but disclosing classified US missile technology to hostile nations would violate ITAR law &amp; land you in jail. I didnt review it, but my team did. Obviously nobody cared about what your article said. Please."
2451,Done
2452,Have a confirmed real name identity section &amp; an unconfirmed identity section. Latter with subscore that excludes probable botnets.
2453,Be careful what you wish for
2454,"Amazingly, the media is awesome vote is declining, despite hundreds of articles attacking this very poll"
2455,My point exactly
2456,"Ahem, you have nano in your bio. That is % synonymous with bs."
2457,Reddit is great
2458,"Come on media, you can do it! Get more people to vote for you. You are literally the media."
2459,Exactly. The point of such a site would be to help restore the credibility of the media. They dont realize how little credibility they actually have with the public.
2460,"Why are certain journalists (editors especially) so concerned about the public rating their credibility? All they do all day is rate others, ostensibly on behalf of the same public for which they have contempt."
2461,I did to any who asked
2462,"That was obvious from a mile away. I tried to use their product &amp; it didnt work. Not exactly a genius move by WSJ, but they were brave enough to say it."
2463,"Maybe after you get your Model , we can talk about what you like &amp; what needs to be improved"
2464,"But consider it real. We could unveil Model Y anytime from late this year to mid next year, so March is about right."
2465,"I just made that up, because the Ides of March sounded good"
2466,Gasoline or diesel?
2467,What car do you drive?
2468,March
2469,The media
2470,"Hi Kara! Im open to it. Right now, Im cranking super hard at the Tesla factory, so it depends on how things are going next week."
2471,"Maybe the media credibility rating site should be called Youre Right! I do actually own , but for the moment I just have it automatically forward to Facebook News."
2472,Definitely
2473,"There no good car emojis. I mean seriously, what the heck are these and this is the best one"
2474,Yo
2475,Thats the basic idea
2476,"For some reason, this is the best Ive felt in a while. Hope youre feeling good too"
2477,"I just tried to donate, but you dont accept PayPal. Lmk when you do."
2478,"Um, you just tweeted about this, so obv you do"
2479,Thank you! I thought it was so obvious
2480,Exactly. UAW does not have individual stock ownership as part of the compensation at any other company.
2481,"Yeah, I think you do great work"
2482,"If youre in media &amp; dont want Pravda to exist, write an article telling your readers to vote against it"
2483,"Ive never stopped a union vote nor removed a union. UAW abandoned this factory. Tesla arrived &amp; gave people back their jobs. They havent forgotten UAW betrayed them. Thats why UAW cant even get people to attend a free BBQ, let alone enough sigs for a vote."
2484,Of course
2485,"It is strange that big auto companies literally have thousands more factory injuries than Tesla &amp; millions more auto deaths, but somehow get less coverage. We are not perfect, but were doing our best to make clean energy real &amp; be a good company."
2486,"No, theyre just some rich kids in Berkeley who took their political science prof too seriously"
2487,Will do
2488,Create a media credibility rating site (that also flags propaganda botnets)
2489,Thats why editors are included too
2490,We dont. The media is reporting someone else saying that Tesla advertised. It is untrue.
2491,"Even if some of the public doesnt care about the credibility score, the journalists, editors &amp; publications will. It is how they define themselves."
2492,Enough of the public does care about the truth. I have faith in the people.
2493,Maybe some good people from those orgs who would join
2494,"Not only needs to be botproof, but seek &amp; unmask anyone operating a disinformation bot army"
2495,Exactly
2496,"Going to create a site where the public can rate the core truth of any article &amp; track the credibility score over time of each journalist, editor &amp; publication. Thinking of calling it Pravda"
2497,An exception that proves the rule
2498,"Uh, this is Twitter. How many characters do you want?"
2499,"Problem is journos are under constant pressure to get max clicks &amp; earn advertising dollars or get fired. Tricky situation, as Tesla doesnt advertise, but fossil fuel companies &amp; gas/diesel car companies are among worlds biggest advertisers."
2500,The media has earned this mistrust. But maybe there is a solution.
2501,Oh hey another sanctimonious media person who thinks hes above criticism. Try being truthful &amp; the public will believe you again.
2502,"Thought youd say that. Anytime anyone criticizes the media, the media shrieks Youre just like Trump! Why do you think he got elected in the first place? Because no ones believes you any more. You lost your credibility a long time ago."
2503,"The holier-than-thou hypocrisy of big media companies who lay claim to the truth, but publish only enough to sugarcoat the lie, is why the public no longer respects them"
2504,"This will sound super obvious, but Genesis &amp; Oblivion"
2505,I am not cool
2506,The one about to come out called So Heavy i fell through the earth
2507,"Was sad to see G getting tons of undeserved flak because of me, so Im glad theres some good too . Her music is incredible."
2508,Thanks. Not super fun right now
2509,Busted
2510,"None of those criteria are certain by themselves, but when taken together &amp; messages have an obv agenda, it almost always indicates use of a network of self-validating troll accounts"
2511,"Troll dead giveaways: not using real names, obv fake pics &amp; backgrounds, low follower/follow ratio, account recently created, repeating same phrases, etc (sigh)"
2512,Great idea!
2513,Will do it later this year. Too much on plate right now. Will be available as an upgrade from service.
2514,Love original Deus Ex! That would be awesome.
2515,Interesting he stops at . Thats when you drove GM &amp; Chrysler into bankruptcy &amp; lost tens of thousands of jobs for people that counted on you.
2516,Just order your car with the James Bond option package. Its an off-menu item for those in the know
2517,"But ya know what, lets test that theory. Maybe we do want UAW back, even tho UAW betrayed us years ago &amp; left us here to rot. Maybe we want UAW back even tho injury rate today is /2 what it was with them &amp; wages were lower. Maybe. Lets hold a vote &amp; find out."
2518,"In theory true, but not how UAW behaved. They drove GM &amp; Chrysler to bankruptcy &amp; lost + jobs for people they were supposed to protect, incl abandoning NUMMI plant workers.Tesla took over &amp; now it has k+ jobs.UAW destroyed once great US auto industry &amp; everyone knows it."
2519,"Were going to include some fun games as hidden Easter eggs in Tesla S, X &amp; . What do you think would be most fun in a car using the center touch screen?"
2520,Good point
2521,"No, UAW does that. They want divisiveness &amp; enforcement of class lords &amp; commoners system. That sucks. US fought War of Independence to get *rid* of a class system! Managers &amp; workers shd be equal w easy movement either way. Managing sucks btw. Hate doing it so much."
2522,"More Reveal bs. Tesla is overseen by Cal/OSHA, most stringent labor safety org in US, &amp; theyve never found us to misrepresent. On other hand, Ford, Chrysler &amp; GM (UAW) have repeatedly been found to fake safety numbers. Strangely, that info is missing from Reveal article"
2523,No problem
2524,"They are incorrect. We never met, nor have we ever been scheduled to meet."
2525,"Thanks again, have conveyed your words to the Tesla team, who have been working crazy hard. Really energizing!"
2526,I didnt meet with him
2527,I definitely dont do this minute thing. Need to have long uninterrupted times to think. Cant be creative otherwise.
2528,Just wanted to say thanks to all Tesla supporters. I damn well love you.
2529,"Have been meaning to get around to talking to him. Some of his criticisms are valid, but, on the higher body/chassis weight front, he wasnt fully appreciating that we were going for much higher crash safety levels than other cars."
2530,"Thanks Ryan. Critical feedback after you get the car would be much appreciated, no matter how nuanced."
2531,"To be clear, all Model cars, incl early production will have same great braking ability. Nature of any product, however, is that if you care about perfection, you make constant small refinements. Todays Model S is far more refined than initial production."
2532,ABS calibration algorithm
2533,"Also, Consumer Reports has an early production car. Model now has improved ride comfort, lower wind noise &amp; many other small improvements. Will request that they test current production."
2534,"Looks like this can be fixed with a firmware update. Will be rolling that out in a few days. With further refinement, we can improve braking distance beyond initial specs. Tesla wont stop until Model has better braking than any remotely comparable car."
2535,"Stop, youre making me blush"
2536,"Also, not promising anything, but we *might* be able to increase Model Performance power output a little"
2537,Complexity is the devil. Words cant express how hard we are working on the Model production ramp &amp; trying to get to profitability. But well try.
2538,"Good point. Yeah, we will do that for the bigger locations."
2539,"The CR braking result is inconsistent with other reviewers, but might indicate that some Model s have longer braking distances than others. If so, we will address this at our expense. First time weve seen anything like this."
2540,"Even if a physical upgrade is needed to existing fleet, we will make sure all Model s having amazing braking ability at no expense to customers"
2541,"Very strange. Model is designed to have super good stopping distance &amp; others reviewers have confirmed this. If there is vehicle variability, we will figure it out &amp; address. May just be a question of firmware tuning, in which case can be solved by an OTA software update."
2542,"Cool, we can do the interview at Tesla in front of the yellow barriers &amp; beeping forklifts you said didnt exist. Please send your meeting request to wakassliar.com."
2543,Gwynnes awesome. Been SpaceX prez for years. Super love working with her.
2544,"Also, UAW did nada for job security in last recession. Dropped Fremont like a hot potato to protect their core base in Detroit. UAW *chose* to exit this plant before Tesla even arrived. We had nothing to do with UAW leaving, but everything to do with why people here have jobs."
2545,Nothing stopping Tesla team at our car plant from voting union. Could do so tmrw if they wanted. But why pay union dues &amp; give up stock options for nothing? Our safety record is X better than when plant was UAW &amp; everybody already gets healthcare.
2546,"Tesla factory literally has miles of painted yellow lines &amp; tape. Report about forklifts not beeping is also bs. These are both demonstrably false, but were reported as facts by Reveal."
2547,Were working on allowing you to use your phone in car when you hear a rattle/squeak &amp; pinpoint origin by acoustic signature &amp; triangulation
2548,SpaceX Crew Dragon ship in anechoic chamber for EMI testing before being sent to Plum Brook vacuum chamber
2549,For sure before snowfall this year
2550,It can tow far more than rated capacity
2551,Exactly! Will probably unveil next gen Supercharger late summer. Major improvements all round.
2552,"With production, st you need achieve target rate &amp; then smooth out flow to achieve target cost. Shipping min cost Model right away wd cause Tesla to lose money &amp; die. Need to months after k/wk to ship $35k Tesla &amp; live."
2553,That means nothing. Literally your Mom could file for NLRB.
2554,Exactly ! That will be really fun &amp; shed light on whats happening. Hoping to start that later this year after we become profitable. Difficult to justify before then.
2555,"Yeah, Reveal was carefully constructed propaganda with a name that wd make Orwell proud. Workplace injury rate of our factory when it was UAW w Toyota/GM was twice as high as todays non-union."
2556,"About % of Tesla, incl salaried &amp; hourly, union &amp; non-union were let go in annual review. Only known union person fired was a guy who repeatedly threatened non-union supporters verbally &amp; on social media &amp; lied about it."
2557,Yes
2558,Exactly
2559,They can form a union whenever they want &amp; theres nothing I can do to stop them. California is a very pro-union state. They just dont want to.
2560,Upgrade to the latest S. Nothing will give you greater joy. Its like being able to have dopamine jacked straight into your brain at will.
2561,"They are correct. Its awesome. Second best driving feel of any car in the world imo, apart from Model S. Traction control precision is super tight."
2562,"It does so constantly, but so smoothly that you cant tell"
2563,Depends on when you placed your initial reservation. We start delivering the dual motor Model in July.
2564,"Three or four months, depending on demand level. We have enough for about /week right now."
2565,Good idea ...
2566,That is true. Electric motors are far more reliable than combustion engines. You need an electric motor just to start a gas engine!
2567,Tesla dual motor means there is a motor in front &amp; a motor in rear. One is optimized for power &amp; one for range. Car drives fine even if a motor breaks down. Helps ensure you make it to your destination &amp; dont get stuck on side of road in potentially unsafe conditions.
2568,Cost of normal dual motor AWD option is $5k. Range is also miles. Takes -60mph to sec &amp; top speed to mph.
2569,Black &amp; white interior available only for Model Performance initially due to limited parts availability. Will broaden over time.
2570,"Tesla AWD is dual motor, so you can fully drive the car even if one breaks"
2571,"Cost of all options, wheels, paint, etc is included (apart from Autopilot). Cost is $78k. About same as BMW M3, but % quicker &amp; with better handling. Will beat anything in its class on the track."
2572,"Tesla dual motor, all-wheel drive performance Model : sec -60mph mph Top Speed mile Range"
2573,"Its only slightly more expensive to Tesla (same price to car owners), but owner happiness is way higher, so worth doing"
2574,Exactly
2575,Will soon enable Tesla owners to request service from their phone with a few taps. Tesla Ranger will come to you to take care of your car. No need to bring the car in yourself &amp; zero paperwork.
2576,Im about to test the configurator &amp; then it goes out to early reservation holders tonight
2577,"You can tweet to Tesla, me and/or get something upvoted in message boards"
2578,That is the way to go. Thanks for buying our cars!
2579,"Also, carbon fiber spoiler, Performance wheels, black &amp; white interior."
2580,"AC induction front &amp; switched reluctance, partial permanent magnet rear. Silicon Carbide inverters in both. Performance drive units are lot sorted for highest sigma output &amp; get double the burn-in."
2581,Working on Model dual motor all-wheel drive &amp; performance versions. Driving feel is amazing. Aiming to release config late tonight.
2582,Check out . Build-your-own life size Egyptian pantheon merch coming soon.
2583,But The Boring Company is right behind you at /15th your speed &amp; soon will be /10th! Start sweating
2584,He taunts us with his speed
2585,Just an ordinary snail
2586,His name is Gary &amp; hes a snail
2587,Skip forward to see the most boring presentation ever
2588,Excited for partnership with LA Metro
2589,lol
2590,Listening to REALiTi
2591,"Yeah, there are thousands of Supercharger locations going through permitting/construction, including that area. Will publish an updated map in the next few days."
2592,Yes
2593,Will be presenting &amp; taking questions about The Boring Company plans for Los Angeles at pm on Thursday
2594,Boring Company Hyperloop will take you from city center under ground &amp; ocean to spaceport in to mins
2595,"Time will tell, but so far it appears so"
2596,"It certainly needs to be better &amp; we work to improve it every day, but perfect is enemy of good. A system that, on balance, saves lives &amp; reduces injuries should be released."
2597,Whats actually amazing about this accident is that a Model S hit a fire truck at mph and the driver only broke an ankle. An impact at that speed usually results in severe injury or death.
2598,"Its super messed up that a Tesla crash resulting in a broken ankle is front page news and the ~40,000 people who died in US auto accidents alone in past year get almost no coverage"
2599,Yes
2600,"According to NHTSA, there was an automotive fatality every M miles in (~40,000 deaths). Tesla was every M miles. Its not possible to be zero, but probability of fatality is much lower in a Tesla. We will be reporting updated safety numbers after each quarter."
2601,"This is false. Eyetracking rejected for being ineffective, not for cost. WSJ fails to mention that Tesla is safest car on road, which would make article ridiculous. Approx X better than avg."
2602,Happy Mothers Day Mom! Love you so much.
2603,"Fair criticism, but were fixing it fast. Hackathon going on right now to fix worst robot production chokepoints. Looks promising."
2604,Lovely story
2605,"If someone is trying to control us through complicated sky patterns, they must really care. I would gladly obey their instructions, but I cant figure them out."
2606,"SpaceX will prob build to rocket cores for ~300 missions over years. Then BFR takes over &amp; Falcon retires. Goal of BFR is to enable anyone to move to moon, Mars &amp; eventually outer planets."
2607,Good piece by Ars
2608,Rate at which things are getting more bizarre appears to be increasing
2609,"Exactly. Gasoline cars will be like steam engines quaint, but not something youd actually use to get around. Btw, I like steam engines &amp; trains in general."
2610,"Yeah, I heard this so many times. In the future, it will seem bizarre that we used to crash rockets into the ocean instead of reusing them."
2611,Yo
2612,Will make that a setting
2613,"Fossil fuels subsidized at $10 million a minute, hours a day, days a week"
2614,No use arguing with chimp. Youre blocked.
2615,"That article was pushed as propaganda to counter IMF study showing fossil fuel subsidies to be $5 trillion/year. Even if $4.9B was true, combined market cap of Tesla &amp; SpaceX is $80B. Where did the other $75B come from? Ass"
2616,I have publicly asked people (like you) not to invest. Go fund Ford or whatever
2617,Launching in ~4 mins
2618,"AWD &amp; white interior in July. Air suspension prob later. Note, thats when we *start* making them. Cant instantly fill all orders. Will take + months to do so."
2619,"Our giant auto co competitors have much greater access to incentives than Tesla, which means Tesla has prospered in spite of govt subsidies, not because of them. Tesla mkt cap has *risen* over time as EV incentives declined. How strange"
2620,"I love it too, but trying to keep config simple so as not to blow up the production ramp"
2621,Tesla will enable orders end of next week for dual motor AWD &amp; performance. Starting production of those in July. Air suspension prob next year.
2622,A cool thing about the design is thats easy to incorporate branch loops to serve small to mid size cities without slowing down the main loop at all
2623,Already started DC to NY route. Hopefully start LA to SF next year. That will be true w pressurized pods in near vacuum tunnels &amp; faster than jetliner.
2624,First Boring Company tunnel under LA almost done! Pending final
2625,"Towards end of next year. Btw, planning to launch Tesla in Turkey later this year. Love your country &amp; will be there in person for the launch."
2626,"This will work on entire S &amp; X fleet, even first production units. Cool thing about software upgrades is that we can keep making your car better long after you bought it."
2627,"All X &amp; S will soon work with no key if your phone pairs w Bluetooth, signal strength is high &amp; you enable feature"
2628,"Yeah, we will add that as a feature"
2629,!! Unnecessary characters. Will change.

2641,Night at the museum. G has mad skillzsz. Me not so much.
2642,Literally every word is untrue
2643,"Thats a white rose on my jacket &amp; the choker is a bunch of spikes, not Tesla anything"
2644,This chart shows how crazy low payout is to labels &amp; the artists only a small fraction of these numbers

2660,What do you think were living in?
2661,It just occurred to me that the plot of Willy Wonka is really messed up
2662,I am super super serious
2663,Im starting a candy company &amp; its going to be amazing
2664,This will be bigger
2665,I try so hard to help them
2666,Thanks for letting me know. Will expedite. Sorry for the delay.
2667,"Looks like sooner than expected. The sheer magnitude of short carnage will be unreal. If youre short, I suggest tiptoeing quietly to the exit"
2668,New Roadster will have that
2669,"Yes, definitely not"
2670,It will be next level. These are really big numbers.
2671,Oh and uh short burn of the century comin soon. Flamethrowers should arrive just in time.
2672,Yup
2673,"True. And once they were on the call, I should have answered their questions live. It was foolish of me to ignore them."
2674,"We went through the same drama on S &amp; X and almost all confirmed in the end. Will likely be even better for Model , as customer satisfaction score post delivery is higher. I worry zero about demand. Just spent all night in the factory, not the showroom."
2675,"Reason RBC question about Model demand is absurd is that Tesla has roughly half a million reservations, despite no advertising &amp; no cars in showrooms. Even after reaching k/week production, it would take years just to satisfy existing demand even if new sales dropped to ."
2676,"The reason the Bernstein question about CapEx was boneheaded was that it had already been answered in the headline of the Q1 newsletter he received beforehand, along with details in the body of the letter"
2677,"The questioners I ignored on the Q1 call are sell-side analysts who represent a short seller thesis, not investors"
2678,Exactly
2679,"First, its important to know that Tesla is the most shorted (meaning most bet against) stock on the market &amp; has been for a while"
2680,Please ignore this thread unless youre interested in a tedious discussion about Tesla stock
2681,They were neither valid nor pertinent. I will explain why on a primary Twitter thread.
2682,"Yeah, news is actually super good. Model S &amp; X are producing major positive cash flow &amp; Model is about to do same."
2683,"To be clear, Im a big fan of MKBHD, but this is an important clarification"
2684,"The dry questions were not asked by investors, but rather by two sell-side analysts who were trying to justify their Tesla short thesis. They are actually on the *opposite* side of investors. HyperChange represented actual investors, so I switched to them."
2685,Youre most welcome
2686,Your numbers are incorrect. Tesla Fremont is rd in world after a place &amp; mall. Giga will be largest when complete.

2692,Ok
2693,Thats how I use my eyebrows too
2694,I have prehensile eyebrows
2695,"Yeah, most people dont know this, but comets r mostly made of cocaine"
2696,Almost ready to test the new Boring Company / SpaceX hyperpod prototype. Exciting video guaranteed.
2697,Dont make me use my space lasers
2698,I know such an underserved market
2699,Oh btw Im building a cyborg dragon
2700,Sounds great riding my cyborg
2701,Likewise was just listening to Go Flex &amp; Psycho on playlist
2702,Mostly not
2703,Tesla batteries are currently live &amp; delivering power at locations in Puerto Rico. Team is working /7 to activate several hundred more.
2704,Russia has great rocket technology &amp; talent. Much respect. Would encourage focus on reusability. Single-use rockets cannot be competitive any more than single-use aircraft.
2705,Doing our best
2706,Now
2707,Driving a Model and playing
2708,"Yeah, exactly! Would be great to hear your thoughts. Were going to try a few approaches. Can def be done, just about minimizing mass."
2709,"We already do targeted retro burn to a specific point in Pacific w no islands or ships, so upper stage doesnt become a dead satellite. Need to retarget closer to shore &amp; position catcher ship like Mr Steven."
2710,And then land on a bouncy house
2711,"Yeah, but great for creating a giant object that retains its shape across all Mach regimes &amp; drops ballistic coefficient by orders of magnitude"
2712,SpaceX will try to bring rocket upper stage back from orbital velocity using a giant party balloon
2713,"This is gonna sound crazy, but"
2714,Interview and Tesla factory tour with Gayle King
2715,Too wasted to remember
2716,"Dont want to brag or anything, but that happens to me sometimes"
2717,"Yes, excessive automation at Tesla was a mistake. To be precise, my mistake. Humans are underrated."
2718,"The Economist used to be boring, but smart with a wicked dry wit. Now its just boring (sigh). Tesla will be profitable &amp; cash flow+ in Q3 &amp; Q4, so obv no need to raise money."
2719,"Sorry, demand has been higher than expected. Making them as fast as possible, but waitlist is to months."
2720,Looking into it. This is bizarre.
2721,Maybe a little
2722,Gwynnes got it covered. Shes awesome.
2723,I love trolls
2724,Norway has some really cool tunnels and bridges
2725,Should be fully fixed within the next few days
2726,Place your bets
2727,This is a very important action by China. Avoiding a trade war will benefit all countries.

2729,SpaceX main body tool for the BFR interplanetary spaceship
2730,Free viewing ends in about hours
2731,Definitely. Will take corrective action immediately. Sorry about this.
2732,Looking into it now
2733,Should just be due to your config not avail yet. If not lmk.
2734,Similar timing
2735,So probably July
2736,We need to achieve k/week with Model before adding complexity that would inhibit production ramp
2737,"This is kinda nutty for such a short distance, so could easily end up being shredded metal, but exciting either way"
2738,Upgraded SpaceX/Tesla Hyperloop pod speed test soon. Will try to reach half speed of sound (and brake) within ~1.2km.
2739,Model is the whole point. We only made the more expensive cars in order to make the mass-market car. We lacked the economies of scale and expertise to make it until now.
2740,The cat videos are awesome
2741,at M views after hours. Congrats to Chris Paine &amp; co!

2749,"Oh, its on"
2750,Most people dont know theres a whole box of Easter eggs with every Tesla. Just tap logo on center screen &amp; wait. Easy access to most of discovered ones. More coming
2751,"Uhh, hello, I need to build cars"
2752,"About a year ago, I asked Doug to manage both engineering &amp; production. He agreed that Tesla needed eng &amp; prod better aligned, so we dont design cars that are crazy hard to build. Right now, tho, better to divide &amp; conquer, so Im back to sleeping at factory. Car biz is hell"
2753,"Cant believe youre even writing about this. My job as CEO is to focus on whats most critical, which is currently Model production. Doug, who I regard as one of the worlds most talented engineering execs, is focused on vehicle engineering."
2754,"We release as soon as we have the data. Good timeline, bad timing. Doesnt matter."
2755,"Not criticizing, just as asking questions. Im sure theres a really great answer"
2756,"Tesla policy is to issue a recall *before* there are injuries. This is absolutely the right thing to do. Yet there were dozens of recalls by other car companies last month, incl w injuries &amp; deaths, but you only wrote an article about Tesla. Why so?"
2757,"Seriously! Obviously, Im not going to do an April Fools joke about going bankwupt if I thought there was any chance it would actually happen (sigh)."
2758,"Lot of respect for NTSB, but NHTSA regulates cars, not NTSB, which is an advisory body. Tesla releases critical crash data affecting public safety immediately &amp; always will. To do otherwise would be unsafe."
2759,"Oh yeah, forgot to mention it actually landed fine, just not on Mr Steven"
2760,What about this?
2761,Elon University is a real place
2762,Coming soon to Tesla merch. Free shots in stores every April st.
2763,As you wish
2764,Its the best
2765,"Elon was found passed out against a Tesla Model , surrounded by ""Teslaquilla"" bottles, the tracks of dried tears still visible on his cheeks. This is not a forward-looking statement, because, obviously, what's the point? Happy New Month!"
2766,"There are many chapters of bankruptcy and, as critics so rightly pointed out, Tesla has them *all*, including Chapter and a half (the worst one)."
2767,"Tesla Goes Bankrupt Palo Alto, California, April , -- Despite intense efforts to raise money, including a last-ditch mass sale of Easter Eggs, we are sad to report that Tesla has gone completely and totally bankrupt. So bankrupt, you can't believe it."
2768,Important news in a few hours

2780,"Turns out joking about being a rock star because of digging tunnels (through, uh, rock hello??) is deeply underappreciated"
2781,"Yes, you can upgrade hardware, although we also wrote software to accelerate rendering on old MCU. Coming out soon &amp; makes a big diff."
2782,"From my Mom: every time I use irony, I lose a friend"
2783,And they said Id never be a rock star

2790,"New Boring Company merch coming soon. Lifesize LEGO-like interlocking bricks made from tunneling rock that you can use to create sculptures &amp; buildings. Rated for California seismic loads, so super strong, but bored in the middle, like an aircraft wing spar, so not heavy."
2791,"New nav starts rolling out this weekend. Should be considered a mature beta at first, so wont be perfect, but will improve rapidly. With the old system, we were stuck with legacy rd party black box code and stale data. No way to improve."
2792,Shocker
2793,Its not a political statement and I didnt do this because someone dared me to do it. Just dont like Facebook. Gives me the willies. Sorry.
2794,I have just asked our team to slow down deliveries. It is clear that we are exceeding the local logistics capacity due to batch build and delivery. Customer happiness &amp; safety matter more than a few extra cars this quarter.
2795,Youll live
2796,Weve never advertised with FB. None of my companies buy advertising or pay famous people to fake endorse. Product lives or dies on its own merits.
2797,"Instagrams probably ok imo, so long as it stays fairly independent. I dont use FB &amp; never have, so dont think Im some kind of martyr or my companies are taking a huge blow. Also, we dont advertise or pay for endorsements, so dont care."
2798,Ok
2799,"What, a troll, me!? How dare you, sir!"
2800,"Yeah, my fault for being an idiot. We did give them a free launch to make up for it and I think they had some insurance."
2801,Definitely. Looks lame anyway.
2802,First time Ive seen either. One on the left looks official. Will be gone soon.
2803,Maybe that word doesnt mean what I think it does
2804,Literally never seen it even once
2805,"Yeah, its borderline. FB influence is slowly creeping in."
2806,I didnt realize there was one. Will do.
2807,Inconceivable! Whod say a thing like that!?
2808,Whats Facebook?
2809,"Wow, a whole week. Risky ..."
2810,Umm...yes
2811,Yes
2812,I double-dare them to come back! Bring it ...
2813,No technology is too advanced for The Boring Company!
2814,"That said, Lori deserves a lot of credit for supporting competitive, commercial space launch while under massive assault from old-school monopolists"
2815,"No real surface is perfect, but it did pull about lbs of muck rail cars out of a tunnel"
2816,"Probably mid next year before we are able to make RHD. Wish it could be sooner. Maybe try a Model S, used or new in the meantime? Used S is better than a new imo, unless you want a smaller car."
2817,Sorry
2818,"Model X pulls a lb (15,000 above US road legal limit) semi truck on a pure snow surface"
2819,Thanks!
2820,Sounds like this canton has style!
2821,Ok
2822,Youre welcome. Sorry for the delay. Only just got back from Gigafactory. Will be at our Fremont factory in the morning. Tesla team is going all out.
2823,Better to be in the Model X
2824,"The Swiss police are smart. Electricity vs diesel &amp; maintenance more than make up for purchase price diff. Plus, the bad guys will def not escape. Thats worth a lot"

2827,"Lori, this is ridiculous. Creating a rocket company has to be one of the dumbest and hardest ways to make money. If it was about money, Id just do another Internet company."

2845,Doesnt make any sense. You cant take things that fail &amp; make them work without creativity &amp; invention.
2846,"No, its not"
2847,None of the above

2859,"To be clear, I think a fair outcome for all is quite likely. China has already shown a willingness to open their markets and I believe they will do the right thing."
2860,"We raised this with the prior administration and nothing happened. Just want a fair outcome, ideally where tariffs/rules are equally moderate. Nothing more. Hope this does not seem unreasonable."
2861,"I am against import duties in general, but the current rules make things very difficult. Its like competing in an Olympic race wearing lead shoes."
2862,"Also, no US auto company is allowed to own even % of their own factory in China, but there are five % China-owned EV auto companies in the US"
2863,"For example, an American car going to China pays % import duty, but a Chinese car coming to the US only pays %, a tenfold difference"

2873,"Falcon flight launches tonight, carrying Hispasat for Spain. At metric tons and almost the size of a city bus, it will be the largest geostationary satellite weve ever flown."
2874,"Very sensible summary of supersonic flight. Obvious answer is to fly high, which gives low drag &amp; low boom amplitude at ground. If boom too loud, airframe design probably wrong too."
2875,Good points. Will add to feature list.
2876,"Yeah, that should improve soon. Software team has been buried in Model bringup and tricky bug fixes, but thats mostly done now."
2877,Almost done

2881,"Higher safety &amp; environmental requirements &amp; labor costs explain only a small part of the difference. True root cause imo is an exponential growth in bureaucracy &amp; a self-serving private sector consultant industry earning a % on project cost, incenting them to maximize cost."

2904,"High altitude wind shear data shows a probable % load exceedance. Small, but better to be paranoid. Postponing launch to tomorrow, assuming winds are better then."
2905,"Todays Falcon launch carries SpaceX test satellites for global broadband. If successful, Starlink constellation will serve least served."
2906,Strange though. Delta IV Heavy has half the payload of Falcon Heavy and the BO rocket doesnt exist yet.
2907,I dont get the little ship thing. You cant show up at Mars in something the size of a rowboat. What if there are Martians? It would be so embarrassing.

2910,My new toaster
2911,Adding software feature to open glovebox automatically when car comes to a stop after a crash. Will look at bonding a thin plastic sheet to the front or back of screen.
2912,Found the source of the problem. The NASA database has the Falcon Block performance. Version currently in production and set to fly in a few months is Block . SpaceX GNC team is submitting updated numbers.
2913,Not enough ignition fluid to light the outer two engines after several three engine relights. Fix is pretty obvious.
2914,"East, to support high flight rates for F9 and dual ocean landings for FH side boosters"
2915,No
2916,A Shortfall of Gravitas
2917,A third is under construction
2918,"Under consideration. Weve already stretched the upper stage once. Easiest part of the rocket to change. Fairing , flying soon, also has a slightly larger diameter. Could make fairing much longer if need be &amp; will if BFR takes longer than expected."
2919,"Side boosters landing on droneships &amp; center expended is only ~10% performance penalty vs fully expended. Cost is only slightly higher than an expended F9, so around $95M."
2920,Of course
2921,"Maybe that plan works out, but I will seriously eat my hat with a side of mustard if that rocket flies a national security spacecraft before"
2922,"That was three years ago, before ULA cancelled all medium versions of Delta IV. Future missions have all Delta fixed costs piled on, so their cost is now $600M+ for missions contracted for launch after . Nutty high."
2923,"Both exhaust velocity (Isp) and mass ratio drive the rocket equation. Also thrust/mass matters a lot for Oberth effect. Delta upper stage Isp is good, but mass ratio and thrust are not."
2924,"The performance numbers in this database are not accurate. In process of being fixed. Even if they were, a fully expendable Falcon Heavy, which far exceeds the performance of a Delta IV Heavy, is $150M, compared to over $400M for Delta IV Heavy."
2925,Love and Rockets

2984,Ok
2985,Hmm ... portal gun. Now that would be interesting.
2986,Youd need millions of zombies for a so-called apocalypse anyway. Where would I even get a factory big enough to make so many!?
2987,The rumor that Im secretly creating a zombie apocalypse to generate demand for flamethrowers is completely false
2988,Good thing you didnt ask about the Freezegun ...
2989,Hmmm
2990,Unless you like fun
2991,"Obviously, a flamethrower is a super terrible idea. Definitely dont buy one."
2992,"ordered already, only left!"
2993,"When the zombie apocalypse happens, youll be glad you bought a flamethrower. Works against hordes of the undead or your money back!"
2994,Dont do this

3000,Falcon Heavy hold-down firing this morning was good. Generated quite a thunderhead of steam. Launching in a week or so.
3001,Check for updates
3002,Done
3003,"Definitely. You will be able to do pretty much anything via voice command. Software team is focused on core Model functionality right now, but that will be done soon, then we will add a lot more features."
3004,There arent even good normal parties in Silicon Valley!
3005,"Actually, you can upgrade the battery pack for a huge improvement in range and some improvement in performance. There are other items you can upgrade too (seats, infotainment, etc), but I recommend keeping those parts original."
3006,That sounds cool. Will do.
3007,Fixed in next release
3008,"Long exposure of rocket ascent, reentry from space and landing burn. (Credit )"
3009,Good idea. We can just have the menu pop up as soon as you put the car into park.
3010,Of course. And an outdoor screen that plays a highlight reel of the best scenes in movie history.

3015,Come work at the biggest &amp; most advanced factory on Earth! Located by a river near the beautiful Sierra Nevada mountains with wild horses roaming free.
3016,Coming very soon
3017,Vastly better maps/nav coming soon
3018,Ok
3019,Sure
3020,"Yeah, its terrible. Had to upgrade old Linux OS and a bunch of drivers first. Major browser upgrades coming to all cars in a few months. Note, will be slower at first until code is optimized."
3021,Similar total size. Maybe slightly bigger to account for a really gamechanging (I think) feature Id like to add.
3022,"Sustainable energy production with solar and batteries will grow much faster than auto on a percentage basis. That will be a big focus next year, with primary remaining Model ramp."
3023,"Was gonna say well do all but the last, but that last one sounds like good, cheesy fun"
3024,Should be in next update
3025,Done
3026,I promise that we will make a pickup truck right after Model Y. Have had the core design/engineering elements in my mind for almost years. Am dying to build it.
3027,"Sorry for the delay. We have the most advanced AI neural net of any consumer product by far, so its going through exhaustive testing. The results are blowing me away though and I think you will have a similar experience."
3028,"Wanted again to send a note of deep gratitude to Tesla owners WW for taking a chance on a new company that all experts said would fail. So much blood, sweat &amp; tears from the Tesla team went into creating cars that youd truly love. I hope you do. How can we improve further?"
3029,"We will! At least, whatever is left over after we build the obelisks."
3030,The circle is complete
3031,Ok
3032,"Hats sold out, flamethrowers soon!"
3033,It does often seem that the most entertaining belief or outcome is the most likely to prevail
3034,True
3035,"So strange that people often believe things inversely proportionate to the evidence. Given a set of possible explanations, why pick the extremely unlikely one!?"
3036,Yes
3037,Having a sinking feeling that most people actually do think it was aliens
3038,"When you get the new Tesla software update, go Ho Ho Ho. Theres an Easter egg inside the Easter egg, but its not funny."
3039,"k limited edition boring hats sold, K to go. Then flamethrower."
3040,I think last night might have been the biggest Rorschach test ever
3041,Isnt it obvious?
3042,"If you liked tonights launch, you will really like Falcon Heavy next month: rocket cores &amp; X thrust. cores return to base doing synchronized aerobatics. rd lands on droneship."

3048,How much is it?
3049,I love Twitter
3050,"Bloody hell, Im going to have to write a blog. Cant fit this into tweets."
3051,I would only call someone an idiot if people were mistakenly under the impression that the person was smart
3052,"However, public transit is obviously not fully solving the problem, as most major cities have been in traffic hell for decades with no solution in sight. Multi-level tunnels can solve this, but we need much better tunneling technology, as it is currently super slow and expensive."
3053,"Major navigation overhaul coming in early . Will be light-years ahead of current system, but we are testing it rigorously before rolling out."
3054,"For the record, I actually love trains, most subways and London buses."
3055,"Idiots can be very dangerous when they seem smart, but arent (having PhD in their bio is a dead giveaway), as some policymakers may get fooled. Thats what really bothered me about that human cat meme / transit expert."
3056,Glad to see that Tesla owners are having a good experience. Working to improve further. Some cool software updates coming soon.
3057,Sorry about that. Thanks for letting me know. Will get it fixed.

3071,k
3072,Meant to say sanctimonious idiot
3073,Good point. Its just a really bad and fundamentally misleading article that doesnt actually represent my point of view at all. Other publications referred to it as an interview.
3074,Sorry
3075,Youre an idiot
3076,"This depressingly misleading &amp; misanthropic article came from a very brief digression at an AI conf, not from an interview with Wired as is falsely implied. This is why I stopped following Wired long ago. There are way better tech pubs out there."

3135,"Not saying the next gen Roadster special upgrade package *will* definitely enable it to fly short hops, but maybe Certainly possible. Just a question of safety. Rocket tech applied to a car opens up revolutionary possibilities."
3136,Should clarify that this is the base model performance. There will be a special option package that takes it to the next level.

3179,And other places
3180,That's just to win our Hyperloop student competition in ~1 mile tube. Practical version would have a turbo compressor on front taking ram air pressure at near sonic to hypersonic speeds &amp; driving that thru air skiis &amp; rearward for thrust.

3199,Assume the worst. Now I need to get back to work...
3200,Answers: Yes. No. Doesn't matter.
3201,"There is only one config being built right now, so the only question is ""What color?"". Don't need a configurator for that."
3202,"Bear in mind that the production ramp is an exponential curve. Late Oct is possible, but not certain. Literally every day makes a big difference."
3203,"Dec will be a big month, so probably, but it is impossible to be certain right now"
3204,Yeah
3205,"I'm doing my best to recalibrate, but that is a fair criticism. However, if I wasn't inherently optimistic, I wouldn't be doing electric cars and rockets in the first place!"
3206,Med medical equipment has priority
3207,Probably to weeks

3213,Not good. Sounds like some rd party installers are taking advantage of Powerwall demand &gt;&gt; supply. Taking action
3214,The internal Tesla Powerwall install team in PR is very small right now. Sending experienced installers from continental US to hire &amp; train local team as fast as possible.
3215,"Tesla always charges the same price for a Powerwall (only taxes &amp; shipping costs vary), so something is messed up here. I've asked my team to stop shipment to any installers charging excessive premiums."
3216,"Sounds good, I look forward to talking later today"
3217,"I would be happy to talk. Hopefully, Tesla can be helpful."
3218,"Hell yeah, with that crew, we will party like Escobar and Cobain wish they could've partied!!"
3219,We should definitely get a room ...
3220,"I know that closet is nice and warm, but it's time you admitted you are one of the creators of the next one. Everyone already knows and we will still love you just as much (almost)."
3221,I'm auditioning to be a roofing spokesmodel in the greater Reno area
3222,"The singularity for this level of the simulation is coming soon. I wonder what the levels above us look like. Good chance they are less interesting and deeper levels are better. So far, even our primitive sims are often more entertaining than reality itself."
3223,"The Tesla team has done this for many smaller islands around the world, but there is no scalability limit, so it can be done for Puerto Rico too. Such a decision would be in the hands of the PR govt, PUC, any commercial stakeholders and, most importantly, the people of PR."
3224,Final episode was disgustingly good
3225,I believe I can fly
3226,Aiming for two rocket landings in hours this weekend

3248,That's not a lot of money for a giant like Daimler/Mercedes. Wish they'd do more. Off by a zero.
3249,"Don't give up if the cause is important enough, even if you believe you are walking into doom. Good friends really matter."
3250,"Absolutely. Moreover, we expect to expand the facility significantly over time."
3251,Does my hivemind count as me?
3252,Def not ok. Just sent a reminder to Tesla stores that we just want people to look forward to their next visit. That's what really matters.
3253,In discussions with national govt. Just need a temporary reprieve on local content requirements until we can build a factory in India.
3254,What if we just made a mini version of the Tesla Semi?
3255,Of course

3264,Astronaut spacesuit next to Crew Dragon
3265,"Fun, exciting tweets coming soon!"
3266,Sorry about that. You're right. I was depressing myself too
3267,"Govts don't need to follow normal laws. They will obtain AI developed by companies at gunpoint, if necessary."
3268,Should be low on our list of concerns for civilizational existential risk. NK has no entangling alliances that wd polarize world into war.
3269,"NK launching a nuclear missile would be suicide for their leadership, as SK, US and China wd invade and end the regime immediately"
3270,"May be initiated not by the country leaders, but one of the AI's, if it decides that a prepemptive strike is most probable path to victory"
3271,"China, Russia, soon all countries w strong computer science. Competition for AI superiority at national level most likely cause of WW3 imo."
3272,Zeroth Law
3273,It begins ...
3274,"Putting together SpaceX rocket landing blooper reel. We messed up a lot before it finally worked, but there's some epic explosion footage"
3275,"Not a bad idea. For sure, it makes sense to test AI for safety in some kind of open world / sandbox virtual world."
3276,In about six months or so. Linked to dual motor config.
3277,We took the SpaceX/Tesla Hyperloop pusher pod for a spin by itself a few days ago to see what it
3278,Tunnels are sealed to atmospheres of water &amp; gas pressure. Just need walls around the apertures.
3279,"Not sure, but probably"
3280,Feature coming soon
3281,"They're so real. Anyone going to that much trouble must really care. I'd gladly follow their commands, but they're so friggin obtuse"
3282,That's pretty much why we did it
3283,"Worth reading Life by . AI will be the best or worst thing ever for humanity, so lets get it right."
3284,Hyperloop (near) vacuum tube runs parallel to SpaceX on Jack Northrop Blvd. It is miles long and just under ft in diameter.
3285,"To be clear, a Hyperloop passenger version wouldn't have intense light strobe effect (just for testing), nor uncomfortable acceleration"
3286,Brakes
3287,Will run the SpaceX pusher sled later this week and see what it can do
3288,"Moon base alpha (cheesy show, but I loved it) plus Mars"
3289,"Not that this is remotely equiv to man on the moon, but there is a world of difference between talking about some random idea and doing it"
3290,"Actually, no, his architecture was different. Also, thinking of going to the moon and actually going to the moon are not the same thing."
3291,Hyperloop pod run by team WARR
3292,"The AI could def find us there, but maybe it won't care"
3293,A Model S in The Boring Company tunnel being dug under Los Angeles (starting in Hawthorne)
3294,"Yes, it is"
3295,A tiny one
3296,"Btw, high accel only needed because tube is short. For passenger transport, this can be spread over + miles, so no spilt drinks."
3297,"No such thing as true vacuum, so actually yes"
3298,Call it ~800mph
3299,"Might be possible to go supersonic in our test Hyperloop tube, even though it's only miles long. Very high accel/decel needed"
3300,"Congratulations to WARR team from Tech Univ Munich for winning nd competition! Peak speed of km/h, which is over mph!!"
3301,Just arrived at the competition final. Student teams have amazing talent!
3302,I hope they and any others trying to advance transport technology succeed
3303,"Exactly. Wouldn't let anyone invest more than a token amount in early rounds of SpaceX and Tesla, as the probability of failure was &gt;90%."
3304,"Sorry! Coming next year, along with completing the Trans-Canada Highway and interconnecting US, Mexico and Central America."
3305,"Funny thing is, whenever I suggest all companies go to zero incentives, room gets very quiet. That's because others get a lot more than us."
3306,Literally zero incentive laws were put into place by my companies. Zero. Others put them in place. Happy to go to zero incentives for all.
3307,I'm not an investor. Just believe in putting money into my own companies. Don't think the OPM approach is right.
3308,"The latter. There are pretty long gaps between each team run, so livestream is not the way to go."
3309,"From last year, but still my favorite video of the Falcon rocket booster returning from space"
3310,SpaceX and The Boring Company are running the Hyperloop competition

3313,Let me check on that for you. Found the answer right here:
3314,It was misinterpreted by Rolfe at WSJ as a fundraising effort. Neuralink is not seeking investors.
3315,WSJ has been laboriously negative for over a decade. I'm surprised they haven't bored their readers to death by now.
3316,Neuralink is not raising money
3317,"Max recovered booster velocity was Mach (BulgarianSat). Energy is velocity squared, so this is a bigger difference than it appears"
3318,"Max velocity: Mach Max altitude: km Highest so far, but velocity matters much more"
3319,Probably m or so
3320,Exactly. Yeah.
3321,Intentionally? Yes
3322,It is approximately the size of a carrot

3340,"We are going to move all info and settings to the ""cloud"" (aka server) so any Tesla you drive in the world automatically adjusts to you"
3341,Pics of SpaceX spacesuit developed for NASA commercial crew program coming out next week. Undergoing ocean landing mobility/safety tests.
3342,Totally agree. This was a foolish oversight.
3343,At some point. Features are prioritized by importance * number of owners likely to benefit.
3344,Yeah. That's been on the future feature list for a while. Need to make sure rain sensor doesn't false positive or drain battery.
3345,Will prob do something like that
3346,Problem is possible impact on curbs or ground objects with the car itself or door swing arc
3347,"Will do. Also, we need to make it a lot easier to adjust the headrest."
3348,"Yeah, it should probably automatically adjust to the user config of whoever is closest to a given door when the handle is touched"
3349,Good point. We will add that to all cars in one of the upcoming software releases.
3350,I love Kermit
3351,"But you can check it out on . Btw, this isn't a video, like cliff diving or fake rocket landings, that matters if it's reversed."
3352,Wigs me out too much. Deleting ...
3353,"Yes, just that the permitting process is slow"
3354,I want one too!
3355,"Tesla Powerwalls can support houses of any size, but the cool thing is we can tow this house around with a Model X!"
3356,"The danger is def high for South Korea, due to proximity, but much less for distant targets like the US. SK anti-missile tech is excellent."
3357,"We certainly could, but, while not suggesting complacency, I'm confident that the US DoD and intelligence orgs have this covered"

3360,For sure
3361,Biggest impediment to recognizing AI danger are those so convinced of their own intelligence they can't imagine anyone doing what they can't
3362,Would like to express our appreciation to Microsoft for use of their Azure cloud computing platform. This required massive processing power.
3363,OpenAI + Dota
3364,It is far too complex for that. Requires a team of the world's best AI researchers with massive computing resources.
3365,"Nobody likes being regulated, but everything (cars, planes, food, drugs, etc) that's a danger to the public is regulated. AI should be too."
3366,"I sure hope so, but we can't take that for granted"
3367,"If you're not concerned about AI safety, you should be. Vastly more risk than North Korea."
3368,OpenAI first ever to defeat world's best players in competitive eSports. Vastly more complex than traditional board games like chess &amp; Go.
3369,Coming soon ...
3370,Hi Mom!
3371,A level orc illusionist and dressmaker
3372,This is about as true as TIME being a paragon of great journalism. Please spend at least seconds checking your facts.
3373,Just because I have the outfit and the awesome weapons doesn't make me a ninja. That requires years of training.
3374,There are dozens of bogus or half-true anecdotes don't really matter &amp; maybe to that do. Guess I could post for those interested.
3375,"One other I'd like to correct from the biography: I never said I was a samurai. Said I was ninja. No, that's a joke. Didn't say that either."
3376,"MB was given weeks of salary &amp; stock in appreciation for her great contribution &amp; left to join a small firm, once again as a generalist"
3377,"Mary Beth was an amazing assistant for over yrs, but as company complexity grew, the role required several specialists vs one generalist"
3378,"Of all the bogus anecdotes, this one troubles me the most. Ashlee never actually ran this story by me or my assistant. It is total nonsense."
3379,"Ashlee Vance's biography is mostly correct, but also rife with errors &amp; never independently fact-checked, despite my request that he do so"
3380,Major increases in the Supercharger and Tesla urban charger network happening over the next several months
3381,First draft animation of the Falcon Heavy three core launch. FH is twice the thrust of the next
3382,I agree. Working on it ...
3383,It's only a matter of time
3384,y
3385,"True, although the changemyview subreddit is least likely to be clicked on by people who really should change their view"
3386,"Arguments, followed, of course, by complaints"
3387,Are you complaining that we are not complaining enough?
3388,And let's not forget the forum on which we are posting I've heard - now this is just a rumor - that people say mean things on Twitter.
3389,Like I said ...
3390,It gets really dark
3391,"True, there are frequent complaint expansion packs"
3392,Except for complaining. That has remained constant throughout history at /100.
3393,Officially verified as the first production electric car to exceed km on a single charge! Congratulations Tesla Owners Italia!!
3394,I guess a proof of concept is needed
3395,Looking forward to launching astronauts to the International Space Station next year!
3396,Sorry about that. You certainly should have been. Will get you guys in a car right away.
3397,"No, must brake safely to a halt"
3398,SpaceX student Hyperloop top speed competition coming up soon!
3399,We poured our heart into the car. Hope you love it.
3400,Sure hope so
3401,Batteries!
3402,"Thoughtful Model review by , one of the most insightful journalists"
3403,"There are several dozen ship names in the Culture series, but I liked those best"
3404,Umm ...
3405,"Yeah, it's better than a Model . We can put a lot more in a car at a higher price."
3406,"I'm sure there are better answers than what I do, which is just take the pain and make sure you really care about what you're doing"
3407,"If you buy a ticket to hell, it isn't fair to blame hell ..."
3408,"Maybe not medically tho. Dunno. Bad feelings correlate to bad events, so maybe real problem is getting carried away in what I sign up for."
3409,Yeah
3410,"The reality is great highs, terrible lows and unrelenting stress. Don't think people want to hear about the last two."
3411,Model uses two intersecting planes of air for vertical control &amp; lateral fins hidden within the dashboard for horizontal control
3412,Model Interior
3413,Yes
3414,Probably middle of next year. Focus now is on getting out of Model production hell. More versions = deeper in hell.
3415,Yes
3416,Sure
3417,"Watched them personally to make sure &amp; I agree with the outcome. Wouldn't have judged differently. Amazing videos all, but was best."
3418,Couldn't believe how incredibly inspiring and creative they were!!

3425,"Sides run high thrust, center is lower thrust until sides separate &amp; fly back. Center then throttles up, keeps burning &amp; lands on droneship."
3426,Side booster rockets return to Cape Canaveral. Center lands on droneship.

3428,Tesla team will verify
3429,Testing The Boring Company car elevator
3430,Love this Tesla P100D drag racing video
3431,Movie on the subject coming soon...
3432,"Tim's piece on AI is excellent, but we actually face a double exponential rate of improvement. AI hardware &amp; software are both exponential."
3433,I've talked to Mark about this. His understanding of the subject is limited.

3436,We can't have too many direct shareholders or we're required to become a public co. Will check if possible through a feeder fund though.
3437,Often comes as a surprise when people learn that % of my time is on engineering/design and just % on other stuff
3438,A m diameter vehicle fits in our existing factories ...
3439,"Yes, I postponed publishing in order to present the updated interplanetary rocket &amp; spaceship design in Adelaide. Will be on the final day."
3440,Discussing physics of tunnels with Mayor Vargas (who has a physics background). Hawthorne support for The Boring Company much appreciated.
3441,Kinda have to
3442,LA-SF-Reno/Sparks would be great. Tesla logistics costs for Sparks-Fremont (batteries &amp; motors) and Fremont-LA (finished cars) are gigantic.
3443,"Verbal approval was at Federal level. Still a lot of work before formal, written approval, but this opens door for state &amp; city discussions."
3444,Adding Boston and Providence would be the natural extension of the line
3445,"An underground Hyperloop would mean no disruption above ground and be way faster, so I think it is he right way to go"
3446,City of Chicago already approached us about doing a high speed tunnel from O'Hare to downtown. They've been great.
3447,"If you want this to happen fast, please let your local &amp; federal elected representatives know. Makes a big difference if they hear from you."
3448,"Still a lot of work needed to receive formal approval, but am optimistic that will occur rapidly"
3449,For sure. First set of tunnels are to alleviate greater LA urban congestion. Will start NY-DC in parallel. Then prob LA-SF and a TX loop.
3450,Support would be much appreciated!
3451,"City center to city center in each case, with up to a dozen or more entry/exit elevators in each city"
3452,Just received verbal govt approval for The Boring Company to build an underground NY-Phil-Balt-DC Hyperloop. NY-DC in mins.
3453,"Plan is to do powered landings on Mars for sure, but with a vastly bigger ship"
3454,y
3455,"True. Need to explain full story of Tesla. So much nonsense out there, amplified by propaganda from some in fossil fuels &amp; confused shorts."
3456,Not attacking Electrek. Just making sure people don't have the wrong impression.
3457,Not true. Email from customer.
3458,"I should clarify: Tesla stock is obviously high based on past &amp; present, but low if you believe in Tesla's future. Place bets accordingly"
3459,"Yeah, otherwise hard to find them"
3460,y
3461,"It is true, so fine by me"
3462,"Small thing (very small), but I made it this way for those who care and understand. Source and appearance are the same."
3463,It's what you don't say
3464,I do have one question. What does GoDaddy mean?
3465,Good point
3466,Fixed. Now it's good.
3467,Yes
3468,Stay tuned
3469,I told you it was verbose. Better tomorrow
3470,"Excited to announce the launch of ! It's a little verbose right now, but that will be fixed tomorrow."
3471,Just checked and yes
3472,"True. Also, Ariane primary bay can deliver slightly heavier satellites than Falcon . Falcon Heavy is needed ..."
3473,Commercially procured launches means launches that were openly competed. SpaceX is not allowed to compete for many US and non-US launches.
3474,US Senate hearing on advancing the exploration and settlement of space
3475,"We do that too, but for free"
3476,Hopefully
3477,"Other orgs shd also develop reusable orbital rockets. If an airplane co had reusable airplanes, buying single use airplanes wd seem crazy."
3478,That doesn't sound right
3479,"Worth noting that Boeing/Lockheed (""Other US"" on chart) get a billion dollar annual subsidy even if they launch nothing. SpaceX does not."
3480,Latest S and X tires have internal acoustic foam
3481,Going over the small nuances of Model production. Very important that nothing sounds tinny.
3482,Cool!
3483,"The very near future, not, like, the far away future"
3484,"You can now drive anywhere in the US (except N Alaska), most of Europe, China &amp; Japan using the Tesla Supercharger network!"
3485,Of course!
3486,"On University Ave, above the old bakery"
3487,"One of my sons is named Xavier, after Professor X!"
3488,That's probably the best use
3489,Cool
3490,Maybe the upcoming IAC in Adelaide
3491,"It was a tough negotiation, but they seemed like good guys. I hope they kept the stock. Would be worth a lot today."
3492,"That pizza looked about as appetizing as drywall. If anything, they were doing people at the party a favor by taking it."
3493,"Wasn't wearing a suit, am def not part of a ""posse"" &amp; didn't even know Leo/Orlando were going. Just went to say hi to my friend Ken Howery."
3494,"Thanks PayPal for allowing me to buy back ! No plans right now, but it has great sentimental value to me."
3495,First Production Model
3496,"It's who is first to pay full price for the car. Hard rule. I have first Roadster and X, but not first S."
3497,"Ira Ehrenpreis had rights to st car as he was st to place a full deposit, but gave those rights to me as my th bday present. Tks Ira!"
3498,Production unit of Model is now built and going through final checkout. Pics soon.
3499,Never heard of them
3500,Stop biting my finger dammit
3501,This will be the highest power battery system in the world by a factor of . Australia rocks!!
3502,"The world's population is accelerating towards collapse, but few seem to notice or care"
3503,"Thanks ! Really proud of the rocket and SpaceX team today. Min apogee requirement was km, Falcon achieved km."
3504,SpaceX team reviewed all systems again late last night. Done our best to ensure all is good.
3505,We're going to spend the th doing a full review of rocket &amp; pad systems. Launch no earlier than th/6th. Only one chance to get it right
3506,Wanted to say thanks to all that own or ordered a Tesla. It matters to us that you took a risk on a new car company. We won't forget.
3507,Looks like we can reach Model cars per month in Dec
3508,"Handover party for first customer Model 's on the th! Production grows exponentially, so Aug should be cars and Sept above ."
3509,Model passed all regulatory requirements for production two weeks ahead of schedule. Expecting to complete SN1 on Friday
3510,Norway is awesome
3511,"Actually, China manufacturing quality is excellent. Among other things, that's where iPhones, many Android phones &amp; most laptops are made."
3512,Another SpaceX launch today if weather is good
3513,Coming later today
3514,Sorry to hear about China launch failure today. I know how painful that is to the people who designed &amp; built it.
3515,Suggestions welcome!
3516,I think Einstein said that
3517,Or does the Earth move up?
3518,This is a really great floor
3519,Just installed steel skeleton of the car/pod elevator. Should be operating next week.
3520,Across the road and below the ground
3521,Perspective
3522,"Nothing to be done, but wait. It's all right here:"
3523,News on Sunday
3524,Because it's off the wall
3525,Maybe it is time for the man cape to return
3526,Didn't read it. Might now though.
3527,Exactly
3528,Me too
3529,"Yes, but arguably that's worse"
3530,And I don't care who knows it. Our love will never die.
3531,Just try one. It's way better than you think.
3532,A floor that moves
3533,A ceiling is simply a floor from below
3534,Not as much as tunnels though
3535,They are so underappreciated
3536,They will never let you down
3537,I love floors
3538,Gary (the snail) is a speed demon. Long way to go before we beat him/her.
3539,"Thanks, but I am"
3540,No longer waiting for Godot. It has begun boring and just completed the first segment of tunnel in LA.
3541,"Good summary of rocket landing history. There were two successful water landings much earlier, but they didn't survive long."
3542,"Several tons of force on each fin at high angles of attack &amp; peak heating is the cube of speed, so a Mach reentry is X Mach . Intense."
3543,They should on high velocity missions to Geostationary Transfer Orbit
3544,Sped up version of today's rocket landing on the Droneship Just Read the Instructions (guess it
3545,More aero effectiveness to create steep spires on windward side at the grid fin intersections
3546,"Down the road, they will not even be repainted between launches. Aiming to be able to relaunch same orbital rocket booster in &lt;24 hours."
3547,Getting closer to fairing recovery and reuse. Had some problems with the steerable parachute. Should have it sorted out by end of year.
3548,New titanium grid fins worked even better than expected. Should be capable of an indefinite number of flights with no service.
3549,Still humans
3550,Significantly improves control force
3551,Launch at :25 delivering satellites for Iridium. Droneship repositioned due to extreme weather. Will be tight.
3552,"Closeup of the titanium grid fins. Not painted, as they glow red hot during a fast reentry."
3553,"We used to have a (lame) open loop hydraulic system, but that was upgraded to closed about years ago"
3554,"Not only that, it has all the wifis and G is coming soon"
3555,Rocket was suddenly slammed sideways right before landing. Heavy gust or something malfunctioned onboard. Reviewing telemetry.
3556,"True, but that's a minor factor for rockets"
3557,"No, but shielding got fragged every flight. More control authority is for Falcon Heavy, but also enables Falcon to land in heavier winds."
3558,"They will, but the hydraulic system is closed loop, so no fluid lost. They do need more power &amp; energy, but rocket has plenty of that."
3559,"Slightly heavier than shielded aluminum, but more control authority and can be reused indefinitely with no touch ups"
3560,Flying with larger &amp; significantly upgraded hypersonic grid fins. Single piece cast &amp; cut titanium. Can take reentry heat with no shielding.
3561,Sticking to
3562,"It's an aluminum honeycomb cartridge, so only a couple of hours to replace"
3563,"Rocket is extra toasty and hit the deck hard (used almost all of the emergency crush core), but otherwise good"
3564,Falcon will experience its highest ever reentry force and heat in today's launch. Good chance rocket booster doesn't make it back.
3565,"Technically, Ironyman"
3566,Thanks! Looks cool.
3567,"Damn, I forgot bacon"
3568,"In life, there are no easy choices"
3569,Do want irony on social media?
3570,Must remember that irony and social media are not friends. Keep forgetting. Dammit.
3571,Radiation
3572,Groan
3573,"But RWD with electric is really good in snow (assuming all weather or winter tires), as traction control is far more precise"
3574,Will extend
3575,Over km should be possible in a D with the right tires
3576,Will be full regen cooled all the way out to the meter (10 ft) nozzle diameter. Heat flux is nuts &amp; radiative view factor is low.
3577,"No plans to change kWh pack tech. You'll never worry about running out of range. Model pack is about cost reduction, not performance."
3578,No need to rely on scientists for global warming -- just use a thermometer
3579,Cool
3580,"That's because the accurate articles are boringly obvious, so they get no press attention"
3581,"First approximation of CO2 is production cost, factoring in energy source, so Model obv less CO2 to produce than $35k gas car by a lot"
3582,Calling this cueless would be generous. Much less energy required for lithium-ion batteries &amp; Gigafactory is powered by renewables anyway.
3583,No plans to change cell form factor for X and S
3584,"This is crazy, but Max Smart mentions Chaos towards the end. Coincidence?"
3585,There's a plot!?
3586,ujelly?
3587,"My real phone is an HTC Droid, which I ordered after seeing this ad"
3588,Nothing beats the shoe phone that is also a real shoe
3589,But then I get paid less
3590,"Backup valve shows no sign of leaking, but yeah"
3591,If schedule holds there will be two Falcon launches within hours (Cape &amp; Vandenberg) this weekend
3592,"Postponing launch to replace fairing pneumatic valve. It is dual redundant, but not worth taking a chance."
3593,"Promising conversations with regarding tunnel network that would carry cars, bikes &amp; pedestrians. Permits harder than technology."
3594,It's time they knew
3595,Tesla service rescues a kitten stuck in the bumper
3596,So soon you won't believe it
3597,Colonizing Mars (thanks Prof Hubbard for creating this from my talk). Major changes to the plan coming soon.
3598,"Hawthorne, California"
3599,Flying through the Falcon Factory
3600,"Mars V2 plan coming soon, which I think addresses the most fundamental flaw in V1: how to pay for development &amp; operation of giant rockets"
3601,Radar-only braking on HW1 is getting better with every release. We're hoping to do the demo where it brakes for a UFO in the fog soon.
3602,"$300M cost diff between SpaceX and Boeing/Lockheed exceeds avg value of satellite, so flying with SpaceX means satellite is basically free"
3603,In discussions with the government of India requesting temporary relief on import penalties/restrictions until a local factory is built
3604,US govt testing by finds Model X to be the safest SUV in history by significant margin
3605,"That would an interesting target. Would, of course, only count if capable of doing so right off the production line with street legal tires."
3606,How'd you know?
3607,"Linux kernel update was way harder than anticipated. Giant improvement, but meant way more OS overhead tuning to keep screen frame rate good"
3608,"New kernel goes out next weekend, new web browser next month. Radar-only braking is getting steadily better for both HW and ."
3609,HW2 Autopilot release should go wide next weekend with additional smoothness improvements to longitudinal control
3610,"We are developing the interplanetary rocket and spaceship to allow anyone to travel to the moon, Mars &amp; beyond, regardless of nationality"
3611,Thanks! Everything we make on the expensive cars goes into developing more affordable cars.
3612,Thanks for supporting Tesla and the EV mission before anyone had heard of us
3613,Heard about it. Our experience doing projects with big car companies was not great. They move slowly &amp; are reluctant to adopt new tech.
3614,"I've written two forward-looking master plans, but haven't told the Tesla history of how we got there. Lot of drama Prob worth doing?"
3615,Mostly right. The feasibility study Martin commissioned about the Lotus Elise was dead wrong though. Only % of parts ended up being common.
3616,"Slow at first, then very fast. Def not hover."
3617,"The faster, the better. Gravity losses."
3618,Damn Stonecutters!
3619,"Was no ""company"", just a (wrong) biz plan to commercialize ACP's Tzero car. No tech or IP, no employees &amp; didn't even own Tesla Motors name."
3620,"Disruption certainly. Deep AI is the real risk, though, not automation."
3621,Exactly
3622,Congrats Robb!
3623,So crazy that people were arrested for trying to keep their cars from being destroyed
3624,You may have Heard of the person who put it together
3625,"Worth watching ""Who Killed the Electric Car?"" By . Truth is indeed stranger than fiction"
3626,"If Zedd is kind enough to send me a list, it's on"
3627,"All Superchargers are being converted to solar/battery power. Over time, almost all will disconnect from the electricity grid."
3628,"I love Norway, which is the world leader in EV adoption! Great example for the rest of the world."
3629,"Long way to go, but we've convinced most of the auto industry to start EV programs &amp; gave them all our patents to help, so that's something"
3630,"Nothing to do w govt incentives or making money. Thought % prob of losing it all (almost did many times), but it was the only chance."
3631,"Since big car companies were killing their EV programs, the only chance was to create an EV company, even tho it was almost certain to fail"
3632,"They was done against the will of their owners, who held a candlelight vigil all night to protest the death of their cars"
3633,Few people know that we started Tesla when GM forcibly recalled all electric cars from customers in &amp; then crushed them in a junkyard
3634,That is true. Ludicrous mode is like having pure joy on tap. Nothing else (legal) will get you that.
3635,Click the left scroll wheel to pause or mute music
3636,"Good point, will add ""cancel nav"" to voice commands"
3637,Too awesome
3638,Must ipso facto half not bee
3639,"First of all, I cracked a long time ago. That's not news. Second, yes, I can see time. How did you know?"
3640,"Yeah, car should auto play when it gets an exact match, like it does for directions. Will make that change."
3641,Just confirmed the Tesla DJ station works in Canada
3642,Cool
3643,"No, it's not!"
3644,Yes
3645,Tap cancel on the screen
3646,"Just tap the voice button on the steering wheel and say ""Play Monty Python"" or ""Navigate home"" or anything. Voice commands work pretty well."
3647,"Just depends on whether you like a sedan or SUV. Sedan goes faster, SUV has more room."
3648,"Yeah, coming back"
3649,Coming soon!
3650,Partly
3651,Possibly my favorite skit
3652,Might work in Canada too
3653,I mean also
3654,Not yet
3655,Yeah
3656,"In the US, you can ask your Tesla to play any Monty Python (or other comedy) skit. Doesn't work outside US yet."
3657,"It's on the car. Might add it to the Tesla app at some point, so you get it on your phone if you have a Powerwall or Tesla solar."
3658,My favorite for sure
3659,Try the new Tesla DJ station on streaming radio
3660,The scene where Brian is saved from the Romans by falling off a tower into a spaceship is the best Deus Ex Machina moment of any movie ever
3661,"All Falcon Heavy cores should be at the Cape in two to three months, so launch should happen a month after that"
3662,Love Monty Python so much
3663,"Just wish they would stop sticking pins in voodoo dolls of me. That hurts, ok?"
3664,Yeah
3665,Yeah
3666,These guys want us to die so bad they can taste it
3667,Could be worse
3668,"We can either give up hope &amp; sit in traffic hell forever or try something new. The odds of success may be low, but they're better than zero."
3669,The Boring Company is in Hawthorne and has already approved the permit
3670,Thanks Such an outrageous lawsuit. People sometimes underestimate strength of US judiciary. Lot of respect for the judge &amp; jury system.
3671,Read
3672,Almost. Falcon Heavy was way harder to develop than it seemed at first.
3673,"Once you add the vintage record player, it's all good"
3674,You're welcome!
3675,"A little red wine, vintage record, some Ambien ... and magic!"
3676,A step facial treatment every morning. The mistake people make is stopping at .
3677,"And um ... not trying to brag or anything, but I think I look good for"
3678,Seems that way
3679,Of course. What base-number system were you using?
3680,That's why the pic is in black and white. Didn't have color back then.
3681,"Yeah, I counted"
3682,Tesla shareholder meeting today. Can't believe it's been years since we went public.
3683,"This is a metaphor for transparency. Also, f* underwear."
3684,Obviously
3685,"SEC disclosures, etc"
3686,"I'm not *saying* they're related, but"
3687,Or is it more about the way you use it?
3688,I hope I'm wrong
3689,"Probably closer to to imo. would be a linear extrapolation, but progress is exponential."
3690,Great comedy! They should write for .
3691,Most likely
3692,"Also, we will have a very high headcount around each Gigafactory keeping it running. They just won't be doing boring, repetitive tasks."
3693,Probably closer to four or five factories. Logistics costs mean you want to be close to the end customer.
3694,California Cabernet
3695,Wearing anything at all is just a conspiracy by the capitalist running dogs of Big Underwear
3696,He was great though
3697,Was just at the DMV &amp; dude had the actual sloth from Zootopia on his desk
3698,"Most people don't realize you can see Dragon approach the Space Station from the ground, even in LA"
3699,Proud of my Mom
3700,"Yeah, pretty much dead center. We painted the target area with radio reflective paint, which helps the radar be more precise."
3701,Exactly
3702,It's starting to feel kinda normal to reuse rockets. Good. That's how it is for cars &amp; airplanes and how it should be for rockets.
3703,First reflight of a Dragon spacecraft set for later today
3704,Good point
3705,India commits to sell only electric cars by . It is already the largest market for solar power.
3706,"Under Paris deal, China committed to produce as much clean electricity by as the US does from all sources today"
3707,Am departing presidential councils. Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world.
3708,Coming soon
3709,Yeah
3710,Will have no choice but to depart councils in that case
3711,"Don't know which way Paris will go, but I've done all I can to advise directly to POTUS, through others in WH &amp; via councils, that we remain"
3712,And then some
3713,"Yeah, it was great!"
3714,Piggyback rides around the Opera House
3715,Sydney is such a beautiful city
3716,A lot
3717,"I do via my foundation, which is now years old, but my grants are (almost always) anonymous"
3718,Yes
3719,Should finish trans-Canada this year. A stop in Swift Current for sure!
3720,Yes
3721,Comparing Model S vs Model
3722,Old-school fidget spinner back when the only things to play with were squirrels and rocks
3723,There will be a combined booster static fire. Maybe a few.
3724,"Btw, that cloud is almost entirely steam, including dark parts (like a storm). This is what the launch looks like:"
3725,"Falcon Heavy is this times three. One way or another, launch is guaranteed to be exciting ..."
3726,Will shut that down. The point is to provide something special that only existing owners can give to friends and it is limited to people.
3727,Only if you want pure joy mainlined straight into your brain
3728,You are right. Going at max speed. Not much time left.
3729,Busted
3730,Will keep the original Bond Lotus sub as-is. That design can't actually convert from car to sub. Have a new design in mind that does.
3731,True
3732,Feel exactly the same way as A.O. Scott. Particularly loved The Spy Who Loved Me
3733,All Model S and X cars will have an auto raise and lower function for the steering wheel in a few months.
3734,I spoke directly with The President three weeks ago about Paris. Many others have too. Cautiously optimistic of a positive decision.
3735,Interesting idea. Would give a dynamic deg surround view as you're driving. Have this in dev mode. Can be a bit distracting though.
3736,"Early next year. To start with, we're making the simplest Model first, like we did with S. Didn't do it with X, because I was an idiot."
3737,We could add that function pretty easily from a technical standpoint. Just need to add in the billing software.
3738,"Can be set higher than that for highways, but limited to +5mph or +8km/h off highway (true avg drive speed) for pedestrian &amp; cyclist safety"
3739,Exactly
3740,Still on for end of year. Just software limited. Any Tesla car with HW2 (all cars built since Oct last year) will be able to do this.
3741,There's just no way. Hundreds of parts and most of wiring harness would have to be replaced. Would cost more to retrofit than trading in.
3742,HW2. HW1 doesn't have enough sensors and computing power.
3743,Hopefully June for those too
3744,S for sure. It is a bigger car.
3745,"I'd highly recommend upgrading to latest Model S (which is approx version ). Only if you really want a smaller sedan, should you get a ."
3746,"Maybe I'm misinformed, but I was told that % of parts must be locally sourced and the supply doesn't yet exist in India to support that."
3747,"Yeah, control algorithm is safe, but unpleasant. New one is even safer, but super smooth."
3748,"Almost there, plus much improved web browser"
3749,That will be tied to deliveries of the first production cars in July
3750,Almost there. Probably in a few months.
3751,"You can easily turn it off in the car via settings, but that would beg the question of why you turned it off"
3752,Something cool for sure
3753,Excited about the Tesla Autopilot software release rolling out next month. New control algorithm feels as smooth as silk.
3754,"Model , Model X &amp; Model S will all have same level of Autopilot capability. It's just a matter of refining the vision &amp; control software."
3755,Wear underpants
3756,Will do
3757,Black and textured slate versions will be
3758,Yes
3759,"For reason I can't explain, I find especially odd. Also, not a fan of . Has led too many people astray in valuing securities."
3760,"Still agree with Tim's points. What ""you"" are is an evolving, mind-body pattern, but there's still a core youness that holds true over time."
3761,"Heisenberg's uncertainty principle &amp; practical limits of simultaneity in transfer make this exact thought experiment impossible, but yeah"
3762,We got stuck
3763,All the answers to questions you never asked about holes in the ground
3764,What pun?
3765,What I love about The Boring Company are the low expectations. Nowhere to go but down.
3766,T-boned in a Model X at mph

3771,And ... it's done
3772,Worked in Minecraft. Just sayin ...
3773,Of course. Why is that even a question?
3774,Imma gonna dig that tunnel with this here hammer
3775,My grandmother was from Moose Jaw
3776,Going to a barn raising!

3780,Yes
3781,"[Warning, this may cause motion sickness or seizures] This is a test run of our electric sled"
3782,"The race between Gary, our pet snail who lives in a pineapple, and Godot, our tunnel boring"
3783,Boring machine segments have been lowered into the starter tunnel. Going through final assembly.
3784,Cutterhead in operation at standard industry speed. Planning to jack this up by a factor of ten
3785,First tunnel for The Boring Company begins ... Full length of first tunnel will run from LAX to
3786,"Entry hole, staging area and starting tunnel for Boring Machine (aka Godot) now complete"
3787,"Tesla needs to iterate fast on solar roof prefab/install technology, so all installs will be done by Tesla techs at first"
3788,Third one will be from Frost. Maybe the second.
3789,Yes. Good.
3790,"First machine is Godot. Still waiting ... Don't know why, when or where."
3791,Naming theme for tunnel boring machines will be poems &amp; plays. Decided against plays &amp; poems. Too obvious.
3792,That's how the tiles sit on the roof. There is no difference in strength for the Tesla tile based on orientation (not like wood).
3793,This is true. The economics are not yet compelling where housing and utility costs are low and property taxes are high.
3794,Slo-mo hail cannonball impacting Tesla solar roof tile
3795,"Will do our best. Hopefully, yes."
3796,Yes
3797,Solar roof can be ordered for almost any country. Deployment this year in the US and overseas next year.
3798,Black glass smooth and textured will be first. Tuscan and French Slate in about six months.
3799,U.K. delivery and installation next year
3800,Yes
3801,Tesla solar glass roof orders open this afternoon. I think it will be great. More in about hours ...
3802,"If heat death of the universe is the destination, it really is all about the journey"
3803,It's a good one
3804,Thanks for doing it!
3805,Headed to see Guardians w my bro and kids. Loved the first one.
3806,"I do love Banks, but perhaps we should reserve his names for the droneships"
3807,Simple. I like it.
3808,Kinda like Snoop Dug
3809,I don't want to be presumptuous
3810,"I know what you're thinking then why not ""the Third""? Well, I've learned my lesson about 's."
3811,"By calling it ""the Second"", it has more credibility"
3812,"Maybe Ultimate Boring Machine, the Second"
3813,Boring Not Boring
3814,Good one
3815,Been done
3816,Thinking about a name for our first tunneling machine
3817,Was just rereading one of my favorites. So beautiful
3818,"Close-up of rocket stage separation, fast flip, boostback burn in a ring of fire and then"
3819,Landing
3820,"Launch and landing of the NRO spy satellite was good. Tough call, as high altitude wind shear was at % of the theoretical load limit."
3821,"Winds aloft are unusually high (still within structural safety bounds). Worrying, but not a showstopper."
3822,"Yeah, will probably publish an update in six weeks or so"
3823,My boring TED talk
3824,Couldn't agree more
3825,Extremely
3826,Even more boring
3827,Boring
3828,"We def want to avoid either, particularly Surface Detail ..."
3829,On it now
3830,"Great food, great ambience and with great friends. We all really enjoyed the visit."
3831,Will definitely do that on my next trip
3832,"Having moo moo at Moo Moo Gold Coast with amberheard, and"
3833,That is the aspiration: to avoid AI becoming other.
3834,"Yeah, sorry I missed that. This would only work for kWh packs that are software created to , so not ."
3835,Yes
3836,Tesla will soon be offering a compelling means of upgrading a to a
3837,July
3838,Pickup truck unveil in to months
3839,Next gen Roadster will be convertible
3840,Tesla Semi truck unveil set for September. Team has done an amazing job. Seriously next level.
3841,Yeah
3842,"Besides, I already said we'd add more independent members during SCTY merger. Will announce soon, but this group has nothing to do with it."
3843,This investor group should buy Ford stock. Their governance is amazing ...
3844,Autolist survey finds Tesla used car values are highest and sell fastest
3845,"Fairing is ~$5M, but that should be reusable this year. Am fairly confident we can reuse upper stage too by late next year to get to %."
3846,Latency should only be min max. Checking ...
3847,Feature coming soon that allows one touch access to all discovered Tesla Easter eggs
3848,And so the robots spared humanity ...
3849,"Exactly. Tesla is absurdly overvalued if based on the past, but that's irrelevant. A stock price represents risk-adjusted future cash flows."
3850,"Et tu, Walt?"
3851,Stormy weather in Shortville ...
3852,Coal is dying due to nat gas fracking. It's basically dead.

3854,It won't matter
3855,Pretty good
3856,"Why did we waste so much time developing silly rockets? Damn you, aliens! So obtuse! You have all this crazy tech, but can't speak English!?"
3857,Technology breakthrough: turns out chemtrails are actually a message from time-traveling aliens describing the secret of teleportation
3858,"Def P100D with Ludicrous+, although the rocket starts going a lot faster after that"
3859,We can def bring it back like Dragon. Just a question of how much weight we need to add.
3860,Working on it
3861,Looks like it could do % more with some structural upgrades to handle higher loads. But that's in fully expendable mode.
3862,A lot
3863,Silliest thing we can imagine! Secret payload of st Dragon flight was a giant wheel of cheese. Inspired by a friend &amp; Monty Python.
3864,"Good point, odds go from % to &gt;0%"
3865,Falcon Heavy test flight currently scheduled for late summer
3866,"Considering trying to bring upper stage back on Falcon Heavy demo flight for full reusability. Odds of success low, but maybe worth a shot."
3867,Browser is already a little better. Kernel and browser update in prob weeks or so (lots of underlying changes) with a few nice features.
3868,Thanks Phil!
3869,Incredibly proud of the SpaceX team for achieving this milestone in space! Next goal is reflight within hours.
3870,"If you just downloaded V8.1, tap the the T on center screen three times"
3871,"On center screen. Also, center screen *will* show speed as an overlay that changes opacity according to relevance."
3872,Very few. We have yet to do a China (or Europe) launch of Model .
3873,Glad to have Tencent as an investor and advisor to Tesla
3874,No
3875,You won't care
3876,What gave me away?
3877,No
3878,Here is the latest SpaceX travel ad for the flight around the moon &amp; into deep space. Maybe needs a few edits ...
3879,"Long Neuralink piece coming out on in about a week. Difficult to dedicate the time, but existential risk is too high not to."
3880,We cannot make all country versions simultaneously or the production start would be a disaster. You would get first in Norway.
3881,Yes
3882,Yes
3883,I believe so
3884,Yup
3885,Oh so little faith
3886,The shorter wheelbase only allows for a kWh pack in Model at current cell/module energy densities
3887,Yeah
3888,Start taking orders in April
3889,"Yeah, probably a year from now. S will still win on acceleration though, due to having more space for a larger battery."
3890,"Only Model S will have the seven seater option, more cargo space, plus higher range, acceleration, two screens vs one, auto extend handles"
3891,The Model S produced today is arguably version . Let me put it this way: it is the car I will keep driving even after Model arrives.
3892,"If fate is on our side, it will be amazing. Will talk about that in detail next week."
3893,No problem
3894,"Should be summer next year. Sorry, really wish we could get RHD done sooner. We truly are working as fast as we can."
3895,Let me just go fetch my magic wand ...
3896,"First in line for dual motor as soon as we can make it, which is probably in to months."
3897,Damn straight we do! Coming with next week.
3898,First drive of a release candidate version of Model
3899,It still has one display
3900,Nothing majorly new that a consumer would notice. Lots of new tech in the design and production process though.
3901,"The more autonomous a car is, the less dash info you need. How often do you look at the instrument panel when being driven in a taxi?"
3902,How about the video we just took of the first Model release candidate drive?
3903,"Yup, machine arrives next month and we start digging the tunnel!"
3904,I think so
3905,"No, we are minimizing configuration complexity to keep the production ramp on schedule. RWD only for early production, just like Model S."
3906,Tues/Wed
3907,Because I was a dumb idiot and didn't realize at the time that it would cause confusion
3908,Tues/Wed next week
3909,"Yes. Model S will always be the fastest Tesla until next gen Roadster, which is a few years away."
3910,"Yes, but not until next year"
3911,Yes. Hardware already on all production S and X cars.
3912,"Sorta. Model is like a BMW series or Audi A4. Model S is like BMW and series, but much faster, more storage space + Autopilot"
3913,How about now?
3914,Oh Model Y is coming too in a few years. Kinda have to.
3915,All Tesla cars built since Oct last year will be capable of self-driving as software improves
3916,Definitely
3917,"Model was going to be called Model E, for obvious dumb humor reasons, but Ford sued to block it, so now it is S3X. Totally different"
3918,Yes
3919,"Model is just a smaller, more affordable version of Model S w less range &amp; power &amp; fewer features. Model S has more advanced technology."
3920,"Am noticing that many people think Model is the ""next version"" of a Tesla, like iPhone vs . This is not true."
3921,Looking forward to playing the game with my kids!
3922,"I used to be one. You're welcome. Trying my best, at least. Hope it's a bit useful."
3923,Just because I'm building a spaceship to get back to my home planet doesn't mean I'm an alien
3924,The number of extinct single planet civilizations probably exceeds live civs by at least a thousand to one. I'm being optimistic.
3925,"Probably. Either that, simulation, great filter or they are very, very subtle."
3926,I hope that didn't work
3927,~spawn npc.alien
3928,Where are the %*&gt; aliens?
3929,Looks like Tues/Wed for release
3930,Except that isn't actually my house ...
3931,"Perhaps there will be some future bill that makes a difference for Mars, but this is not it."
3932,I am not. This bill changes almost nothing about what NASA is doing. Existing programs stay in place and there is no added funding for Mars.
3933,"is a great car, but definitely Model S"
3934,Good point
3935,I wish. It's so annoying.
3936,"Finally, an explanation for daylight savings that makes sense ..."
3937,Ok
3938,"It's been a bear to get done, but prob days or so, depending on full speed autosteer test results"
3939,"Looking forward to it. I know it's cliche, but LotR is my favorite book ever Want to see the set and take my kids on tour of greater NZ."
3940,"Sure. Just check out my prior tweet on pricing ($250 kWh at pack level). Website will be updated soon, so there is complete transparency."
3941,". Can only happen with your support, and working closely with key govt and utility leaders who are strongly committed to trying new approaches"
3942,"Just wanted to write a note of appreciation to the many Australians who came out in support of the battery plan, especially"
3943,I love Wikipedia. Just gets better over time.
3944,"Answer is complex for electric motors. We use an AC induction motor fed by a DC pack thru an IGBT inverter, which kinda ""digitizes"" DC power"
3945,High voltage DC is for sure the best way to transmit electricity over long distances. Good explanation at
3946,"Ironically, direct current is the right approach today, even though alternating was right in the past. Solar power &amp; electronics both DC."
3947,You're most welcome. Very exciting to discuss the future of electricity. Renewables + storage arguably biggest disruption since DC to AC.
3948,"Just spoke with , Premier of South Australia. Very impressed. Govt is clearly committed to a smart, quick solution."
3949,"Yes, but shipping, taxes/tariffs and installation labor vary by country, as those costs are beyond our control"
3950,$250/kWh at the pack level for MWh+ systems. Tesla is moving to fixed and open pricing and terms for all products.
3951,Tesla will get the system installed and working days from contract signature or it is free. That serious enough for you?
3952,Will send you one
3953,Self-hatred
3954,Thanks JJ!
3955,Thank you for the lovely letter. That sounds like a great idea. We'll do it!
3956,SpaceX could not do this without NASA. Can't express enough appreciation.
3957,"This is not true. TM works for a lot of people and that's great, but I've maybe done it or times ever."
3958,Fly me to the moon ... Ok
3959,SpaceX announcement tomorrow at pm PST
3960,of course
3961,maybe one of those too
3962,Roller coasters are awesome
3963,Something on a tristate border might work. Gigafactory plus nearby supporting supply chain needs a very large workforce.
3964,Good chance it will
3965,Exactly
3966,I didn't pose for it (hopefully that's obvious) or want me on cover. Tunnel boring machine pic wd be way better
3967,Minor improvements update this weekend. High speed autosteer in about two weeks.
3968,Excellent Tesla Model X review
3969,Just posted a video
3970,Baby came back
3971,no
3972,System was green for launch. I called it off.
3973,"They are often right, but, in this case, we have already retired so much R&amp risk on Dragon , that I feel very confident of ."
3974,"Uses high pressure bleed off the fuel side (RP-1 kerosene) turbopump, so no dedicated pump or fluid needed"
3975,"Btw, % likely to be fine (closed loop TVC wd overcome error), but that % chance isn't worth rolling the dice. Better to wait a day."
3976,"Not obviously related to the (very tiny) helium leak, but also not out of the question"
3977,"If this is the only issue, flight would be fine, but need to make sure that it isn't symptomatic of a more significant upstream root cause"
3978,"All systems go, except the movement trace of an upper stage engine steering hydraulic piston was slightly odd. Standing down to investigate."
3979,Counting down to the first SpaceX launch from the Apollo launch pad tomorrow morning (webcast
3980,spacex's photo
3981,"Provided Dragon demo missions go well, SpaceX is highly confident of being able to fly US astronauts in"
3982,Looks like we are go for launch. Added an abort trigger at T-60 secs for pressure decay of upper stage helium spin start system.
3983,"Investigating a (very small) leak in the upper stage. If ok, will launch tomorrow."
3984,"Yes, but only deep in solid rock, where the walls are self-supporting and concrete reinforcements arguably aren't needed"
3985,It's much easier to do the CGI that way
3986,Daylight rocket launch &amp; landing at the Cape this weekend. Will be the st SpaceX flight from the Apollo launch pad.
3987,I used that one
3988,"Ok, what are some good ones? Will have to meter these out. Hopefully, kids can't die from groaning too much."
3989,They are doing India proud
3990,You may come to regret that request
3991,"Yeah, exactly. So that makes it cool, right!?"
3992,"Yeah, awesome achievement by ISRO. Very impressive!"
3993,"Apparently, there is this thing called ""Dad jokes"" and I make them"
3994,"You're right, I can't hide any more! I am Irony Man..."
3995,they were earlier drafts that I accidentally published. I said the same thing a week already.
3996,"In appreciation, Tesla is providing all repair costs free of charge and expedited."
3997,Congrats to the Tesla owner who sacrificed damage to his own car to bring a car with an unconscious driver safely to a stop!
3998,Best place to watch is on the Cape causeway
3999,Sounds like the Tesla Powerwall (consumer) and Powerpack (utility/commercial) might be useful
4000,Falcon rocket now vertical at Cape Canaveral on launch complex -A. This is the same launch
4001,Exactly. What this person said is untrue.
4002,"Please check your facts. Tesla and SpaceX joined as soon as we received the filing, which was Monday."
4003,of course it will
4004,Should all be uploaded by next month
4005,Motor Trend could only achieve sec when they tested the Porsche
4006,I don't know what make you think that's a rocket. It's completely covered in a tarpaulin...
4007,George Schultz and Jim Baker article in regarding a carbon tax
4008,yes
4009,Hoping for summer this year
4010,"yes, altitude improves performance for electric. Opposite of combustion cars."
4011,"No, will be lower. Wheelbase can't fit ."
4012,"Also, Tesla service can remove front trunk liner if you don't use it and improve performance further"
4013,"No plans to take X, S (or ) above kWh. Semi necessarily and pickup truck maybe will go above."
4014,Take out the floor mats and its . MT said everything had to be standard production.
4015,yes
4016,Production Tesla Model S P100DL sets Motor Trend all-time world record to mph in sec
4017,Signing off now. That was more than enough Twitter trouble for one morning!
4018,No rare earth metals in battery
4019,Almost ready
4020,App update is about two weeks out. Linux kernel and browser update probably a month or so. HW2 Autopilot has priority.
4021,"Yes, but Model is the overwhelming priority"
4022,I will post an article he wrote half a century ago about flying through Africa and Asia in his plane. One of my favorite things.
4023,Almost there. We are just being very careful with the rollout.
4024,A lot of terrible things could happen in four years of extremism. Do you really want another war? That's where extremism leads.
4025,"Yeah, it is hard to convey complex ideas in chars and tone is lost in text"
4026,People should push to have as many moderates advising the President as possible. Blind hate is never the right answer.
4027,Rolling out a new update today.
4028,We should try our best
4029,"Really? Ok, I will work harder on thinking first and tweeting second. Sorry for anything thoughtless."
4030,I just had three coffees
4031,Mars is critical for the long-term survival of humanity and life on Earth as we know it
4032,Numeric
4033,Gravimetric energy density of batteries and achieving a high cell mass fraction
4034,"I love Canada! I'm half Canadian. My Mom was born in Regina. My grandfather (her Dad) was American, born in Minnesota."
4035,Me too. I hope to get back to regularly scheduled programming soon ...
4036,"I agree, great country! Looking forward to taking my kids for a visit. I've heard it is incredibly beautiful."
4037,True. Me being one of them
4038,"Not perfect &amp; cd be better, but th out of + countries with only a diff to ""1st"" place means it's essentially on par"
4039,"Fair point, sorry"
4040,"Activists should be pushing for more moderates to advise President, not fewer. How could having only extremists advise him possibly be good?"
4041,Exactly
4042,Norway is great on all levels. Love Norway!
4043,Yeah. And Twitter is a hater Hellscape.
4044,"Good grief, I'm not ""working"" for Trump. I'm trying to provide advice that helps take things in a more positive direction."
4045,"Actually, I think it's kinda cool"
4046,Isn't that basically like having a jury of peers? That is a default option in the US.
4047,"Those countries have strong justice systems, but I'd put them roughly on par with US. That rating system conflates many factors."
4048,Did you read my tweets? I attacked it hard. Did not defend.
4049,You're right. Politics is a no-win situation. Somebody is going to hate what you say no matter what that is.
4050,Also good. There are several that are on par with US. Just don't think any are better. People confuse laws with courts.
4051,Mostly anti-drug laws
4052,Exactly
4053,"The laws need to change. Judges are responsible for evaluating whether an action breaks the law, not making law."
4054,The remedy for that is changing the law
4055,"Ok, but what's up the wigs?"
4056,There are many good legal systems on par with US. Just don't know any that are better.
4057,True!
4058,"Many in America don't realize how proud they should be of the legal system. Not perfect, but nowhere is the cause of justice better served."

4066,Really don't want to get in politics. I just want to help invent and develop technologies that improve lives. Feels so bizarre.
4067,"Yes, for now, but this should be addressed on all fronts: judicial, legislative and executive."
4068,"In addition, I again raised climate. I believe this is doing good, so will remain on council &amp; keep at it. Doing otherwise would be wrong."
4069,"At my request, the agenda for yesterday's White House meeting went from not mentioning the travel ban to having it be first and foremost"

4075,There has already been and there will be progress on this matter
4076,Regarding the meeting at the White House:
4077,yes
4078,Headline &amp; article is misleading. I said it won't be retracted (ie withdrawn by Pres). It may be revoked by judicial or legislative means.
4079,"Yes, I believe that is critical to ensure a good future for humanity"
4080,Top AI researchers agree on principles for developing benefical AI

4082,"Yeah, sorry about that"
4083,"Yes, the order is still bad, but it is always important to read the source material"
4084,Reading the source material is better than reading other people's opinions about the source material
4085,Strategic &amp; Policy Forum
4086,"Exactly. There is no possibility of retraction, but there is possibility of modification. It's just a non-zero possibility. Don't know more."
4087,Please read immigration order. Lmk specific amendments. Will seek advisory council consensus &amp; present to President.
4088,It is not
4089,"Many people negatively affected by this policy are strong supporters of the US. They've done right,not wrong &amp; don't deserve to be rejected."
4090,The blanket entry ban on citizens from certain primarily Muslim countries is not the best way to address the countrys challenges

4092,And we start digging the tunnel tonight
4093,Hyperloop pod race happening this weekend at SpaceX HQ (near LAX). We built a ~mile long vacuum tube on our campus big enough to fit people.

4409,Particularly trying to understand the quieter bang sound a few seconds before the fireball goes off. May come from rocket or something else.
4410,"Support &amp; advice from , , &amp; others much appreciated. Please email any recordings of the event to report.com."
4411,Important to note that this happened during a routine filling operation. Engines were not on and there was no apparent heat source.
4412,Still working on the Falcon fireball investigation. Turning out to be the most difficult and complex failure we have ever had in years.
4413,It's been a little crazy lately
4414,"yes. This seems instant from a human perspective, but it really a fast fire, not an explosion. Dragon would have been fine."
4415,Finishing Autopilot blog postponed to end of weekend
4416,Loss of Falcon vehicle today during propellant fill operation. Originated around upper stage oxygen tank. Cause still unknown. More soon.
4417,"Not allowed, according to HK regulations. Happy to do it if regs change."
4418,We need to do one more minor rev on and then will go to wide release in a few weeks
4419,Writing post now with details. Will publish on Tesla website later today.
4420,Major improvements to Autopilot coming with V8.0 and software (std OTA update) primarily through advanced processing of radar signals
4421,uh oh
4422,Thanks for the longstanding faith in SpaceX. We very much look forward to doing this milestone flight with you.
4423,one of my favorite games as a kid
4424,Making progress. Maybe something to announce in a few months. Have played all prior Deus Ex. Not this one yet.
4425,Journalist Q&amp;A for mins and embargo ends at :30
4426,Tesla product announcement at noon California time today
4427,Owner account of a Model X severely impacted by a Yukon
4428,Correlation is not causality or ... is it?
4429,Sunday morning: to bake or not to bake cookies -- that is not even a question. Definitely bake.
4430,"Congrats to on her novel, ""Acts of Love""! All characters even those based on real people are entirely fictional"
4431,Over the entrance of
4432,true
4433,Will try out this weekend. Maybe reality is just a series of nested simulations all the way down ...
4434,Would like to thank and Jensen for donating the first DGX-1 AI supercomputer to in support of democratizing AI technology
4435,"Yeah. Movie still enjoyable due to some great characters, but plot &amp; editing could've been better. Really needed more Joker+Harley."
4436,Sure feels weird to find myself defending the robots
4437,Never. There is no product rationale for doing so.
4438,probably makes sense to build off the pickup truck chassis
4439,Model Y (compact SUV) off Model chassis. Tesla Bus/Minibus/Spacebus off Model X.
4440,good point
4441,I think we should be inconsistent in our naming conventions after Model Y
4442,View of Dragon from cupola
4443,We are definitely patenting this idea
4444,glad people had a great time!
4445,"not bad, I like those suggestions"
4446,Gigafactory in units of hamster
4447,Some good guessing by . The Tesla Minibus will be built on a Model X chassis. People density potential is surprisingly high.
4448,Will be live streaming the Gigafactory launch party tonight. Check this eve.
4449,The libertarian argument for a carbon tax
4450,"Good summary of yesterday's Gigafactory Q&amp;A with JB, Yamada-San and me"
4451,Should mention that Gigafactory will be fully powered by clean energy when complete &amp; include battery recycling
4452,happy birthday!
4453,Insurance premiums expected to decline by % due to driverless cars
4454,Letter from basically every scientific org in the United States to Congress about climate change

4456,Maybe as a future optimization. Would only matter if it was extremely big.
4457,as long as I'm alive
4458,Looking forward to the Gigafactory opening party on Friday next week. The scale blows me away every time I see it.
4459,Autopilot prevents serious injury or death of a pedestrian in NY (owner anecdote confirmed by vehicle logs)
4460,"Jerome is driving Tesla Semi &amp; doing a great job with his team. At Daimler, he led their most successful semi truck program ever."
4461,It's inspired by some of the California Custom VW combi design art
4462,Great game. Whole Fallout series is amazing.
4463,Both should have been done under the same corporate umbrella from the beginning
4464,"Tesla Master Plan, Part Deux"
4465,now Pac
4466,California time
4467,Post should go live on Tesla website around pm
4468,yup
4469,busted
4470,Except for the tweet about large amounts of crack (actually just small amounts)
4471,Not easy to convey irony in a tweet
4472,Lana
4473,Finishing off the plan while listening to the soundtrack from Gatsby. Seems appropriate...
4474,"Will be working at Tesla on Autopilot &amp; Model today, then aiming to pull an all-nighter and complete the master product plan"
4475,I am!
4476,Returning from Cape Canaveral to California...
4477,"Really tempting to redesign upper stage for return too (Falcon Heavy has enough power), but prob best to stay focused on the Mars rocket"
4478,Can't wait to see all three cores of Falcon Heavy come back for landings! First two will be almost simultaneous.
4479,Landing
4480,free Babel fish provided
4481,Bit of a distraction yesterday. Working on plan today.
4482,Out on LZ-1. We just completed the post-landing inspection and all systems look good. Ready to fly again.
4483,Falcon on LZ-1 at Cape Canaveral
4484,"Thanks. Exactly. Some in the press think they're so much smarter than Tesla owners that ""they know better"". Makes no sense."
4485,"V8 will be our biggest release since v1, so taking longer to refine. Awesome on every level. Meeting w design team every day."
4486,"Tesla customers are v smart &amp; don't want media speaking on their behalf abt Autopilot. Recent poll: % want it disabled -- not %, %."
4487,"It can at moderate range, but our ultrasonics are very good at human (or anything &gt;= water density) detection"
4488,Improved fan speed algorithm coming soon. Doesn't need to be so loud.
4489,Great rebuttal by a Tesla owner to those calling for Autopilot to be disabled. Was written with zero input from us.
4490,That is a very good point!
4491,Have to focus on tonight's launch. Will post Tesla (master) product plan afterwards.
4492,"Btw, want to thank both Bosch and MobilEye for their help and support in making Autopilot better. Please direct all criticism at Tesla."
4493,"Promising call today with , maker of our radar sensor. Looks like significant improvements possible via OTA software update."
4494,much appreciated
4495,Usually true. We need more sane and reasonable people making their voice heard.
4496,Sensible article on Autopilot by guardian
4497,On the other hand I do answer a toy phone like it's real
4498,large amounts of crack
4499,"hours normally, but a lot less these days"
4500,Sunday is the end of the week
4501,yes
4502,good up to ~160km/h
4503,Our radar is using a wavelength of mm. A good size for both decent resolution and rain penetration. Am hopeful...
4504,especially well
4505,Logs were downloaded for NHTSA and NTSB. Identical copies to all.
4506,"Good thing about radar is that, unlike lidar (which is visible wavelength), it can see through rain, snow, fog and dust"
4507,yes
4508,certainly moderate and maybe big advances w no incremental hardware
4509,effective stereo by comparing data at various points in time while moving
4510,elevation too
4511,only just gained access to physical vehicle
4512,AP process crash would show up in logs
4513,"Working on using existing Tesla radar by itself (decoupled from camera) w temporal smoothing to create a coarse point cloud, like lidar"
4514,"Maybe didn't realize he turned it off, but the car does issue a loud chime and a visual warning on the instrument cluster."
4515,exactly
4516,"Onboard vehicle logs show Autopilot was turned off in Pennsylvania crash. Moreover, crash would not have occurred if it was on."
4517,EU regulators find no safety concerns with Autopilot
4518,It's all fun &amp; games until ...
4519,We don't mind taking the heat for customer safety. It is the right thing to do. From
4520,can't wait to see the costume
4521,Only if I can play a monkey
4522,"Tesla finishes last in being salesy! Good. Also, I can't believe there is a real Pied Piper."
4523,Something like that
4524,already taken care of
4525,Kinda. Creating a seamlessly integrated Tesla battery &amp; solar power product that looks beautiful is the reason
4526,I like your tweets!
4527,"Tricky in chars, but: B needed for min statistical sample size. More software mods and data may be needed beyond that."
4528,Blog on Autopilot by
4529,US is ~11 deaths per billion miles. WW is deaths per billion. Autopilot already much better than either so far.
4530,Unless we get there and find it isn't enough. Just won't be before B.
4531,"It is extensively tested in the lab and in the Tesla test fleet. However, there is no substitute for real world experience."
4532,"With less than B miles, there simply isn't enough data. B is a necessary but not necessarily sufficient condition."
4533,"Thanks. Point of calling it ""beta"" was to emphasize to those who chose to use it that it wasn't perfect."
4534,exactly
4535,"that wasn't criticism, just clarification"
4536,why?
4537,thought I was posting Reuters. Copied the wrong link.
4538,Probably six months. Will include hundreds of refinements to handle rare corner cases in Autopilot.
4539,"you're right, no point"
4540,"Use of word ""beta"" is explicitly so that drivers don't get comfortable. It is not beta software in the standard sense."
4541,"Misunderstanding of what ""beta"" means to Tesla for Autopilot: any system w less than B miles of real world driving"
4542,Today is Nikola Tesla's birthday. I hope he likes what we've done in his name.
4543,"Working on Top Secret Tesla Masterplan, Part . Hoping to publish later this week."
4544,"Story was fed to LAT &amp; many other media to counter IMF $5T/year fossil subsidy study. Hey, both have a !"
4545,seriously
4546,Love reddit. Gandel gets shredded &amp; won't even answer top upvoted questions. Some really funny comments about Koch
4547,"Model S had the lowest probability of injury of any car ever tested by NHTSA, which is why ..."
4548,thanks
4549,"true, good point"
4550,"No, you were misleading mostly on your own, but w many copycats. Jalopnik just lost it's sense of irony &amp; didn't get my tweet."
4551,"cool, thanks"
4552,The Google term of self-driving would probably be more appropriate then.
4553,"In other words, the intended implication is that a driver must remain alert, just as a pilot must remain alert."
4554,"Tesla Tesla Autopilot is named after aircraft autopilot, as it is always expected that a pilot must stay alert."
4555,"All publicly known Tesla product developments are called out, incl vehicles and batteries. Would be odd *not* to include."
4556,Tesla response to the misleading Fortune articles about Autopilot
4557,Sponsored articles
4558,Because of course I hate flamingos...(maybe try eating fewer flamingo eggs in your salad)
4559,Exactly! I love Twitter.
4560,Wrong to exclude non-occupant deaths. Autopilot would have prevented this cyclist from being killed
4561,"If you care about auto deaths as material to stock prices, why no articles about M+/year deaths from other auto companies?"
4562,"Yes, it was material to you -- BS article increased your advertising revenue. Just wasn't material to TSLA, as shown by market."
4563,Radar tunes out what looks like an overhead road sign to avoid false braking events
4564,Our condolences for the tragic loss
4565,Shakespeare. Then love-devouring death do what he dare; It is enough I may but call her mine.
4566,aspirationally
4567,"My son recently asked what my favorite animal was. Well, of course"
4568,Thoughtful analysis of the Tesla/SolarCity merger by
4569,Thanks for the kind bday wishes!
4570,cute!
4571,exactly
4572,We haven't signed anything for a factory in China
4573,"Deluded, deranged, etc. Journalistic thesaurus sure got a lot of use last week ..."
4574,"Article is misleading to readers. No one is ""taking home"" anything. In a stock for stock transaction, nothing comes off the table."
4575,Of course. Our love will never die.
4576,This is going to be great
4577,Drive units and battery are sealed
4578,"If curious abt TSWLM car, am still planning to do a sports sub car that can drive on roads. Just a side project. Limited market potential"
4579,"We *def* don't recommended this, but Model S floats well enough to turn it into a boat for short periods of time. Thrust via wheel rotation."
4580,Tesla owner drives through a flooded tunnel &amp; out the other side
4581,"As mentioned at the beginning of the year, I'm expecting ~70% success rate on landings for the year. is the year of experimentation."
4582,Looks like early liquid oxygen depletion caused engine shutdown just above the deck
4583,"Turns out the landing was not as fast we thought, but still hard enough to destroy the primary airframe and accordion the engines"
4584,Thanks Tyler
4585,Landing video will be posted when we gain access to cameras on the droneship later today. Maybe hardest impact to date. Droneship still ok.
4586,Upgrades underway to enable rocket to compensate for a thrust shortfall on one of the three landing engines. Probably get there end of year.
4587,Quite rapid... Yes
4588,RUD = Rapid Unscheduled Disassembly
4589,Looks like thrust was low on of landing engines. High g landings v sensitive to all engines operating at max.
4590,"Ascent phase &amp; satellites look good, but booster rocket had a RUD on droneship"
4591,Highly recommend anything by Sean Carroll
4592,"Am concerned that advanced life may be inherently unstable. Arguably, any civ capable of extinguishing itself eventually will."
4593,"Life you can talk to is another matter, of course. Many, many orders of magnitude less likely."
4594,No way. Look at chemotrophs and extremophiles. Primitive life is bloody everywhere. Highly under the ice on Europa imo.
4595,Hence the urgency of making life as we know it multiplanetary as soon as possible
4596,"That, speed of light constraint and quantum mechanics"
4597,"And, no, I'm not an alien...but I used to be one"
4598,Latest science predicts &gt; trillion alien civilizations. Either they don't last long or there are a *lot* of aliens
4599,"Yeah, that matches what we've found so far. More likely unhinged than nefarious."
4600,Would seem to indicate that one or more people sought to create the false impression of a safety issue where none existed. Q is why?
4601,"Of greater concern: of suspension complaints to NHTSA were fraudulent, i.e. false location or vehicle identification numbers were used"
4602,NHTSA confirmed today that they found no safety concern with the Model S suspension and have no further need for data from us on this matter
4603,That is correct. It was about innovation.
4604,Nice comment about the Model S by CvK on
4605,no
4606,Something about a flying metal suit...
4607,yes
4608,S and X cells are also Panasonic
4609,Would like to clarify that Tesla is working exclusively with Panasonic for Model cells. News articles claiming otherwise are incorrect.
4610,Fourth rocket arrives in the hangar. Aiming for first reflight in Sept/Oct.
4611,"PC, of course"
4612,Highly recommend by the good people of if you like ultrafast team FPS action
4613,Trippy
4614,I love Douglas Adams! My favorite spaceship ever is in HHGTTG.
4615,Exactly
4616,Good article from explaining how little incentives have actually contributed to Tesla funding
4617,how did you know?
4618,Creating a neural lace is the thing that really matters for humanity to achieve symbiosis with machines
4619,exactly
4620,It is simulations all the way down
4621,"At this point, I'm really running out of crazy things to say. Any suggestions?"
4622,control of super powerful AI by a small number of humans is the most proximate concern
4623,Just heard that Norway will ban new sales of fuel cars in . What an amazingly awesome country. You guys rock!!
4624,"Yay, baby made it home!"
4625,autosteering chutes will be added soon
4626,Recode interview with and via
4627,Supercharger policy explained well by : Will post detailed description soon. I think it's a good balance.
4628,Good summary of Tesla annual meeting by
4629,Sorry to hear that. Will take care of this &amp; investigate to see if issues you encountered are systemic.
4630,So it was good for you too ...
4631,Fast replay of today's rocket landing on SpaceX droneship OCISLY
4632,"Very similar. The crush core in the Falcon legs is reusable after soft landings, but needs to be replaced after hard."
4633,Crush core is aluminum honeycomb for energy absorption in the telescoping actuator. Easy to replace (if Falcon makes it back to port).
4634,"Rocket landing speed was close to design max &amp; used up contingency crush core, hence back &amp; forth motion. Prob ok, but some risk of tipping."
4635,Satellite deployed to km apogee. All looks good.
4636,mins to launch
4637,"There was a tiny glitch in the motion of an upper stage engine actuator. Probably not a flight risk, but still worth investigating."
4638,Really fun Model X review by . Best part is X racing while towing a fuel sports car
4639,"Flight is def capable of flying again, but it makes sense to apply ground delta qual to rocket w toughest entry conditions."
4640,Great image of ancient Mars
4641,"No prob. We care about doing what's fair &amp; just. Don't always get it right, but intent is always there &amp; we make amends when wrong"
4642,"Per the letter, Tesla paid $55/hr for *additional* services, so no."
4643,"Yes, but it is false of Merc News to say that Tesla took advantage of low cost labor. We paid $55/hr. That is unequivocal."
4644,"We still need to make sure that the injured person is taken care of, but less &amp; less of the Merc story appears to be true"
4645,Merc News story about Tesla using $5/hr labor seems to be missing a digit. Tesla actually paid $55/hr.
4646,"Totally agree. Am told this will be fixed by Thurs, maybe Fri."
4647,Full height of Falcon boost stage on legs is ~165 ft
4648,"Falcon Heavy side boosters can use most of the same airframe as Falcon , but center core needs to be buffed up a lot for transfer loads."
4649,Response to a Mercury News article about an injury on our premises
4650,Only heard about this today. Sounds like the wrong thing happened on many levels. Will investigate and make it right.
4651,"Better. Not there yet, but a solution is likely."
4652,yes
4653,yup
4654,"Most recent rocket took max damage, due to v high entry velocity. Will be our life leader for ground tests to confirm others are good."
4655,Three's company
4656,will do another AMA just before reflight of the rocket in a few months
4657,Dog snuggle thread on reddit. Comments get really good.
4658,Excited to announce Tesla's entry into automotive racing!
4659,tambin te amo
4660,It's probably the Ambien
4661,Definitely
4662,Ok
4663,Full credit to the team that's doing this. All happening without any help from me.
4664,coming soon
4665,Certainly agree that it is first and foremost a triumph for humanity. The cheering is in good spirit.
4666,I think so
4667,Max is just X Merlin thrust and min is ~40% of Merlin. Two outer engines shut off before the center does.
4668,I love you too!
4669,"Launch trajectory of Japanese commercial satellite JCSat-14, enroute to km above Earth"
4670,Thank goodness all are ok
4671,"Yeah, this was a three engine landing burn, so triple deceleration of last flight. That's important to minimize gravity losses."
4672,May need to increase size of rocket storage hangar
4673,Woohoo!!
4674,"Rocket reentry is a lot faster and hotter than last time, so odds of making it are maybe even, but we should learn a lot either way"
4675,"Tesla is increasing the production ramp as fast as possible, but I'd recommend ordering a Model soon if you want delivery"
4676,yes
4677,Filtering particulates from air makes a significant &amp; measurable diff to health. Wd like to credit Larry Page with turning me on to this.
4678,Bioweapon Defense Mode is real This is what happens when you turn it on:
4679,"Have been reviewing end of line production quality personally. Slowed things down temporarily, but it's for the best."
4680,Historical precedent. Mars vehicle will be metric.
4681,next month (with a lot of other good stuff)
4682,exactly
4683,"sides def, center maybe"
4684,naturally
4685,Falcon Heavy thrust will be M lbf at liftoff -- twice any rocket currently flying. It's a beast...
4686,F9 thrust at liftoff will be raised to M lbf later this year. It is capable of M lbf in flight.
4687,F9 LEO payload on capabilities page (correct figure on main page) should be kg
4688,"No cross feed. It would help performance, but is not needed for these numbers."
4689,No physical changes to the engine. This thrust increase is based on delta qual tests. It is just tougher than we thought.
4690,Max performance numbers are for expendable launches. Subtract % to % for reusable booster payload.
4691,"Basically current, but higher throttle setting. Good performance of recent launches allows us to reduce sigma reserve margin."
4692,Just posted latest max payload capabilities of Falcon and Heavy
4693,yes
4694,turns out it doesn't need securing
4695,yes
4696,"yes, several times"
4697,for sure
4698,things like this should be purged shortly
4699,+ for almost everything + for heat shields and a few other items.
4700,Zuck doesn't (yet) have a deep tech understanding of AI. I spend hours every week being educated by world's best researchers.
4701,"JCSat is pushing the envelope as a very hot and fast mission, so will land on the droneship. Next land landing in a few months."
4702,System scan detected only % of orders with same email and physical address. Those have been purged.
4703,of course
4704,Temporary spike in some areas due to X rd row seat recall. Should be sorted by June.
4705,"Duplicates will be cancelled. Max of will be delivered to any one person. Only ~5% of orders are , so speculation unlikely."
4706,Simple answer is that there just aren't many used Teslas available. Demand &gt;&gt; supply.
4707,checking into it ...
4708,will definitely do so
4709,"some places are trickier than others, but yes. That's the value of having a PICA-3 heat shield with propulsive landing."
4710,"It could land on Venus no problem, but would last maybe a few hours. Tough local environment."
4711,But wouldn't recommend transporting astronauts beyond Earth-moon region. Wouldn't be fun for longer journeys. Internal volume ~size of SUV.
4712,Dragon is designed to be able to land anywhere in the solar system. Red Dragon Mars mission is the first test flight.
4713,"A should be workable, but an S or particularly an X would be better"
4714,That article was incredibly misleading and you should know it. Wager right now that Sun has received far more than Tesla?
4715,Looks like Model X resale value is holding up well
4716,"Aiming for relaunch in to months, pending detailed examination and X refiring of a returned booster"
4717,We have amplified pre-delivery inspection to provide a stronger second layer of QA. Several parts being replaced as a result.
4718,By land and sea
4719,Will be interesting to see what the meantime to Hitler is for these bots. Only took Microsoft's Tay a day.
4720,Owner video of Autopilot steering to avoid collision with a truck
4721,Godot Full play
4722,"Have recently come to appreciate the awesome, absurdist humor of Waiting for Godot. We so often wait, without knowing why, when or where."
4723,me too!
4724,Great video history of Falcon by Kinematic
4725,needs latest update
4726,"Activate autopilot X in quick succession for psychedelic cowbell road. And, yes, we are adding more cowbell soon."
4727,"Not from us, but it's awesome"
4728,"Well, I thought TLI might be upset about using their material without permission. Apparently not"
4729,Thanks
4730,yes
4731,"Tickets to orbital hotels, the moon and Mars will be a lot less than people think."
4732,"Just wanted to write a note of appreciation for all those who have supported Tesla, SpaceX &amp; SolarCity over the years. Thank you."
4733,Thanks on behalf of an amazing team at SpaceX!
4734,Thanks!
4735,Thanks for your support! Looking forward to delivering the goods for you.
4736,"Screen cap from the stern cam of droneship ""Of Course I Still Love You"""
4737,"Reasons for ocean landing are technical, not economic. Orbit requires extreme horizontal velocity. Getting to space needs none."
4738,SolarCity panels produce enough zero carbon energy to charge entire Tesla fleet
4739,Nickel is also in nickels
4740,"Battery uses no rare Earth metals. Main ingredient is nickel, which is what's used to coat cutlery, so very non-toxic."
4741,"Over k cars or ~$14B in preorders in first week. Only % ordered max of two, suggesting low levels of speculation."
4742,the only thing beyond ludicrous is plaid
4743,"yes, will go all the way to Alaska"
4744,"Dex will do comms, but my speeches are just a conversation w the audience. No time to rehearse &amp; don't want to read from a prompter."
4745,we will
4746,Doesn't sound right. Will check into it.
4747,We are working on enlarging the opening. Aperture will be big enough for almost anything.
4748,Most telling is that the SpaceX Propulsion CTO switched from driving a Porsche Turbo S to a Model X
4749,Model X review
4750,probably unwise
4751,"won't be a hatchback, but we should be able to increase the opening width and height"
4752,yes
4753,yes
4754,yes
4755,yes
4756,sounds good
4757,"Signing off from impromptu Twitter AMA. Thanks for the suggestions. Btw, we really will have more cow bells."
4758,Coming soon for all Tesla cars. Just an OTA software update.
4759,"yes, coming this year"
4760,Air suspension dynamically adjusts ride height
4761,you can do that now with S and X. Will be same for .
4762,correct
4763,hopefully
4764,what's the link to that?
4765,"No, but we will need to build a factory in Europe to serve long-term regional demand as Fremont reaches max capacity."
4766,no problem
4767,Will cover whole country hopefully this year
4768,"yes, but production AWD will be a lot faster"
4769,less
4770,torque is shifted between front &amp; rear motors every ~.01 secs. Traction control is way better than a normal AWD. Digital vs analog.
4771,"And, of course, it will have more cowbells."
4772,"Model will be RWD, with dual motor AWD optional. Even RWD will have great traction on ice due to fast torque response of Tesla drivetrain."
4773,yes
4774,Superchargers and service centers will cover all of Italy later this year
4775,definitely
4776,should be addressed this year
4777,Only way to get enough rear passenger headroom was to move the rear roof cross-car support beam. A bike will still fit no problem.
4778,that's not the real steering system
4779,yes. Will easily fit two child seats. Three if you buy slim seats.
4780,Some tweaking underway
4781,Wait until you see the real steering controls and system for the . It feels like a spaceship.
4782,Won't happen. Reason initial cars are delivered close to factory is to have rapid turnaround on early issues.
4783,Edge and contour refinement are ongoing. Even .1mm matters.
4784,They can. Will be great for road trips and camping
4785,It will make sense after part of the Model unveil
4786,"A Model order gives you priority in your geography, so, even tho total count is high, ordering early will make a big difference locally."
4787,"In general, product comments, suggestions and criticisms are always welcome"
4788,We always try to maximize customer happiness even if that means a revenue shortfall in a quarter. Loyalty begets loyalty.
4789,There will be an optional tow hitch.
4790,Our production ramp plan should enable large numbers of non X/S customers to receive the credit.
4791,Matte black was surprisingly popular. Probably makes sense to bring it to production.
4792,"cool, thanks!"
4793,"Yes, if the trend continues, before"
4794,k Model orders by end of Sat
4795,Model design sketches
4796,"We are working on an exact date, but Tesla will be in India before production starts."
4797,They will. We spent a lot of time on those.
4798,"Roadster, S and X customers are the ones who got us here and are paying for . They deserve a lot of credit."
4799,"we will send something to everyone who ordered, but an extra gift for those who stood in some crazy long lines"
4800,"yes, within a region. Can't deliver to all regions simultaneously. Too much complexity."
4801,and a few other things
4802,"Token of appreciation for those who lined up coming via mail. Thought maybe -30 people per store would line up, not . Gifts on order."
4803,Maybe /4 to /2 of what happened. No one at Tesla thought it would be this high before part of the unveil.
4804,"Will give an update tonight for the day total, then last one on Wed for the full week. All efforts focused on accelerating the ramp."
4805,k as of am this morning
4806,thanks!
4807,Now k orders
4808,of course
4809,"Giga is designed to self-power via solar panels (primarily), wind &amp; geo, using its own batteries to store electricity at night."

4811,should be within a week or two max
4812,"Hi Alyssa, thanks for placing your faith in Tesla. I hope you have a great experience with the car."
4813,Definitely going to need to rethink production planning...
4814,"Thought it would slow way down today, but Model order count is now at k. Recommend ordering soon, as the wait time is growing rapidly."
4815,"Model orders at in hours. Selling price w avg option mix prob $42k, so ~$7.5B in a day. Future of electric cars looking bright!"
4816,Will include India-wide Supercharger network
4817,sure!
4818,Coming in the mail
4819,Hardware in all cars. Autopilot safety features standard. Convenience features optional (like S and X).
4820,Just order the SpaceX option package!
4821,"Thanks for tuning in to the Model unveil Part ! Part is super next level, but that's for later"
4822,"yes, will cover whole country"
4823,yes
4824,sure is
4825,X and S will also be available
4826,"Adding several more countries to Model order page tonight. Check for details, but will include India, Brazil, SA, SK, NZ, Sing &amp; Ireland."
4827,"Model orders, whether in store or online, are limited to two per person"
4828,Online ordering at will now open at :30pm Pacific to ensure no server overload. Presentation still at :30.
4829,From almost anywhere
4830,Coming soon!

4832,Model unveil will be webcast live at :30pm California time at
4833,"You will see the car very clearly, but some important elements will be added and some will evolve."
4834,"Tomorrow is Part of the Model unveil. Part , which takes things to another level, will be closer to production."
4835,Model order day starting in Australia
4836,You can now buy cruise ship tickets for the Arctic passage. Seeing is believing.
4837,Great article by . Important to note max temp record. Too much attention on avg temp. Max matters most
4838,Looks like we may need to increase production plans for the Model
4839,Tesla charger map

4841,sure
4842,"Turn off recirc. Air exits thru rear vents. Snap in shade also avail from service, but I just tint the rear window."
4843,no
4844,The AEI meeting wasn't secret and I was only there for a few hours to talk about Mars and sustainable energy. Nothing to do with Trump.
4845,Congrats to DeepMind! Many experts in the field thought AI was years away from achieving this.
4846,"SpaceX &amp; Tesla comp is same or better than other companies. Big diff is that we don't outsource manufacturing, retail sales or service."
4847,"SpaceX and Tesla rated most meaningful work in high tech. Also, most stressful, but that goes with the territory."
4848,Wasn't done at my request. Good hacking is a gift.
4849,"Rocket landed hard on the droneship. Didn't expect this one to work (v hot reentry), but next flight has a good chance."
4850,Target altitude of km achieved. Thanks for riding on Falcon ! Looking forward to future missions.
4851,We spoke earlier today and he said he would investigate the situation.
4852,. SpaceX has not donated to any presidential campaign
4853,Evolution hasn't advanced much
4854,MIT Technology Review
4855,checking ...
4856,exactly
4857,Pushing launch to Friday due to extreme high altitude wind shear. Hits like a sledgehammer when going up supersonic
4858,Only heard about it today. Doesn't sound like they are in the right though in their dealings with our subcontractor.
4859,Launch aborted on low thrust alarm. Rising oxygen temps due to hold for boat and helium bubble triggered alarm.
4860,AF has placed launch on hold due to a boat entering the edge of the keep out zone. Scrambling helo to get them to move.
4861,"Great leg room for rd row, rear visibility better, easy storage of long cargo."
4862,"yes, it actually performed better than other colors on stain tests. Best not to have vented seats w kids though."
4863,"Can't emphasize enough that white is the best interior. Also, pick seats unless you really need ."
4864,"That said, the white interior is the best. Highly recommend."
4865,Heavy use of the white causes splitting. Adding backing material to strengthen. Will be upgraded at no cost.
4866,Worth reposting the Wait But Why piece on AI. We are at the beginning of exponential growth in digital intelligence.
4867,Next gen Atlas robot
4868,coming later this year
4869,"There is no way it is only %, given the staggeringly massive number of fossil subsidies that exist in every country, or as high as %."
4870,"Global economy of $100T is overwhelmingly fossil fuel based, so IMF estimate of $5T or % for carbon subsidy is def right order of magnitude"
4871,Just wanted to thank Stu G for . Know it meant a lot to you. Will take good care.
4872,Don't you already have a spaceship?
4873,Worth noting that all gasoline cars are heavily subsidized via oil company tax credits &amp; unpaid public health costs
4874,Sigh
4875,Hi
4876,"yeah, that's a great one too"
4877,Little bit
4878,"Worth watching ""Nathan for You"" on Comedy Central, particularly the ""Dumb Starbucks"" and ""Mechanic/Realtor"" episodes"
4879,My coffee tastes unusually good this morning
4880,yes
4881,Interesting to think of physics as a set of compression algorithms for the universe. That's basically what formulas are.
4882,"yes, this was done jointly with Tesla and Radio Flyer"
4883,This baby Model S really is quite fun
4884,More details on Model unveil in coming weeks. That's it for now.
4885,yes
4886,No signature series for Model . Same reservation amount for all.
4887,global
4888,Model reservations ($1000 down) will be accepted in Tesla stores on March and online April
4889,good point
4890,Should mention that Tesla Motors itself had nothing to do with the short movie. This was completely independent.
4891,Love this Tesla video made by
4892,My job moonlighting as a police officer in Brazil is no longer secret
4893,Must be a slow news day if denying service to a super rude customer gets this much attention
4894,Interesting name
4895,I didn't take anyone's car and never would. Car was actually allocated to engineering test (not by me) and inadvertently sold.
4896,"My best guess for : ~70% landing success rate (so still a few more RUDs to go), then hopefully improving to ~90% in"
4897,Thanks Jeff
4898,"Falcon lands on droneship, but the lockout collet doesn't latch on one the four legs, causing it"
4899,"Stage would reach low Earth orbit if not hefting a second stage, but payload would be greatly reduced."
4900,"Actually, didn't get environmental approval in time, but it was also good practice for missions where a ship is needed."
4901,"If speed at stage separation &gt; ~6000 km/hr. With a ship, no need to zero out lateral velocity, so can stage at up to ~9000 km/h."
4902,Ship landings are not needed for flexibility or to save fuel costs. Just not physically possible to return to launch site
4903,"As mentioned before, ship landings are needed for high velocity missions. Altitude &amp; distance don't mean much for orbit. All about speed."
4904,steel collet
4905,"Well, at least the pieces were bigger this time! Won't be last RUD, but am optimistic about upcoming ship landing."
4906,probably
4907,"However, that was not what prevented it being good. Touchdown speed was ok, but a leg lockout didn't latch, so it tipped over after landing."
4908,"Definitely harder to land on a ship. Similar to an aircraft carrier vs land: much smaller target area, that's also translating &amp; rotating."
4909,Maybe some debris ingestion. Engine data looks ok. Will borescope tonight. This is one of the outer engines.
4910,"Conducted hold-down firing of returned Falcon rocket. Data looks good overall, but engine showed thrust fluctuations."
4911,Next launch is a science mission from VAFB California on Sunday.
4912,Aiming to launch this weekend and (hopefully) land on our droneship. Ship landings needed for high velocity missions
4913,Sad to hear that David Bowie died. He was amazing.
4914,"In ~2 years, summon should work anywhere connected by land &amp; not blocked by borders, eg you're in LA and the car is in NY"
4915,"Tap your phone or key and your car will open the garage door, exit, close the door and come to you. Will do same in reverse for unsummon."
4916,First baby step in Tesla Summon capability now downloading over-the-air with V7.1
4917,"Worth reading The Machine Stops, an old story by E. M. Forster"
4918,"Falcon back in the hangar at Cape Canaveral. No damage found, ready to fire again."
4919,High res video of landing from the helo
4920,Live video from LZ-1
4921,Falcon standing on LZ-1 at Cape Canaveral
4922,thanks!
4923,There and back again
4924,Thanks Jon!
4925,"satellites deployed to target orbit and Falcon has landed back at Cape Canaveral. Headed to LZ-1. Welcome back, baby!"
4926,Background on the launch
4927,Launch &amp; landing can be seen on the webcast or in person from Cape Canaveral public causeway at :33pm local tmrw
4928,Just reviewed mission params w SpaceX team. Monte Carlo runs show tmrw night has a % higher chance of a good landing. Punting hrs.
4929,Currently looking good for a Sunday night (~8pm local) attempted orbital launch and rocket landing at Cape Canaveral
4930,Meant to reply to this article:
4931,This article does not appreciate that Tesla is in California despite taxes net of rebates being higher. Incentives only a partial offset.
4932,"Static fire test looks good. Pending data review, will aim to launch Sunday."
4933,Rounding up to sec for a bit of timing margin. Updating flight computer command sequence
4934,Aborted on ignition timing due to slow ground side valve. Adjusting ignition sequence by secs for next attempt.
4935,About mins from static fire
4936,holding for issue resolution
4937,Abort triggered by flight computer on upper stage throttle valve. Adjusting thresholds and restarting count at T-10 mins.
4938,mins from static fire test
4939,"yes, from F to F"
4940,It worked in Texas
4941,F in this case. Deep cryo increases density and amplifies rocket performance. First time anyone has gone this low for O2.
4942,Falcon is vertical on the launch pad at Cape Canaveral. Working towards static fire. Deep cryo liquid oxygen presenting some challenges.
4943,Not really my letter (no authorship contribution). Just agreed to add my name when they asked.
4944,Vance article on self-driving cars was inaccurate
4945,Announcing formation of
4946,Aiming for Falcon rocket static fire at Cape Canaveral on the th and launch about three days later
4947,Agreed. Working on it.
4948,wow
4949,Best of luck to the Cygnus launch
4950,Nice ride! Looking forward to seeing you tomorrow.
4951,Good summary of my talk in Paris on climate change
4952,About to give a talk at the Sorbonne
4953,"Yep, good points. I hope you get back into space some day!"
4954,But credit for st reusable suborbital rocket goes to X-15 And Burt Rutan for commercial
4955,Jeff maybe unaware SpaceX suborbital VTOL flight began . Orbital water landing . Orbital land landing next.
4956,"Not quite ""rarest"". SpaceX Grasshopper rocket did suborbital flights years ago &amp; is still around."
4957,The F9 booster can reach low orbit as a single stage if not carrying the upper stage and a heavy satellite.
4958,"Getting to space needs ~Mach , but GTO orbit requires ~Mach . The energy needed is the square, i.e. units for space and for orbit."
4959,"It is, however, important to clear up the difference between ""space"" and ""orbit"", as described well by"
4960,Congrats to Jeff Bezos and the BO team for achieving VTOL on their booster
4961,"Sounds perfect, you had me at ""enterprise""."
4962,Yeah and hell yeah
4963,From anywhere
4964,Should mention that I will be interviewing people personally and Autopilot reports directly to me. This is a super high priority.
4965,We are looking for hardcore software engineers. No prior experience with cars required. Please include code sample or link to your work.
4966,"Ramping up the Autopilot software team at Tesla to achieve generalized full autonomy. If interested, contact autopilot.com."
4967,definitely aliens!
4968,Current production is LTE. Can be upgraded by service.
4969,well done!
4970,noted
4971,"Wow, that's great!"
4972,Model S Ludicrous Mode achieves sec -60 mph and sec /4 mile in Motor Trend test
4973,"yes, comes with each car"
4974,"Compliment from Jeffrey is much appreciated, but the people of Tesla deserve all the credit"
4975,I should clarify that is an independent website. We don't have any control over the content.
4976,Cool!
4977,"Hopefully, mid to late next year. We are being more cautious abt expanding countries to ensure a great user experience each time."
4978,"Given high local demand, a Gigafactory in India would probably make sense in the long term."
4979,"Yes, establishing charging and service infrastructure in Mexico now. Official launch in next several months."
4980,Auto import duties are prohibitively high. Hoping for a special category for EVs. Most of our discussion was about batteries.
4981,We just finished building a huge expansion in Tilburg!
4982,"These are all things I've said before and are naturally needed to improve in-market affordability, so no real news here."
4983,Model is due in ~2 yrs. A China factory for local demand cd be as soon as a year after. A factory in Europe wd happen for same reason.
4984,My comments in China weren't transcribed correctly. Tesla will keep making cars &amp; batteries in CA &amp; NV as far into future as I can imagine.
4985,"important to set AC to not recirc (air exits thru rear) and use the snap in shade, which Tesla service can provide"
4986,Amount of change needed is enormous - like a spinal cord transplant. Would cost less and work better with a new car.
4987,"Autopilot coming soon: curve speed adaption, controller smoothness, better lane holding on poor roads, improved fleet learning!"
4988,"Regulatory approvals received, so Autopilot rolling out to all countries! (Excluding Japan, which is still under review)"
4989,all
4990,Hoping for Friday release
4991,Good feedback. Will write up a list of software priorities in the coming weeks.
4992,What esthetic and functionality improvements would you like to see in the UI overhaul? Or new features entirely?

5459,"Abort was caused by oxygen in ground side TEA-TEB. Upper stage on separate internal circuit, so doesn't face same risk."
5460,"Rocket engines are healthy, but cleaning turbopump gas generators will take another day. Aiming for Mon eve launch."
5461,Will do. Probably at least a few days. Depends on whether we need to pull the turbopumps.
5462,We called manual abort. Better to be paranoid and wrong. Bringing rocket down to borescope engines ...
5463,"If launch aborts, we will bring the rocket down for engine inspection, so probably a few days before next attempt"
5464,"Increasing helium spin start pressure. Probably &lt;50% chance of passing all aborts, but worth a try. Countdown resuming ..."

5479,Headed to Cape Canaveral tomorrow for first geostationary satellite launch.
5480,Tesla Model S Consumer Reports customer satisfaction survey highest of any car on road at /100
5481,Tesla is also extending the Model S warranty to cover any fire damage even if due solely to a driver accident
5482,What makes this incredibly unjust is that the Model S to date has the best safety record of any car on the road (no injuries or deaths ever)
5483,Why does a Tesla fire w no injury get more media headlines than gas car fires that kill s of people per year?

5585,"Am not suggesting shutting down CO2 production, but rather to price in environmental cost &amp; shift to sustainable energy"
5586,"Even if the answer is only on the order of %, we should still take immediate action, as there is only one atmosphere."
5587,Right question to ask Dyson or others: what is probability that human actions could cause catastrophic climate change?
5588,What most serious scientists have a problem with is the notion of certainty about *any* subject. That is not the point.
5589,Very few. Scientific consensus at time of Columbus was world was round

5605,"Trees are net consumers of CO2, so technically we would pay them money"
5606,Exactly. Seems crazy to risk the CO2 chemical experiment when we have to find another solution anyway.
5607,Big difference between taxing people and taxing purchases (ie consumption). Much better to emphasize the latter.
5608,The collective wisdom of the market is usually (not always) better than the smartest govt regulator.

6103,I heard Lars von Trier optioned the movie rights
6104,"That said, even though they cause me grief, I would defend the right of shorts to exist. They are often unreasonably maligned."
6105,That's not just paranoia (a healthy trait at times). Tesla really is under massive attack by short sellers
6106,Will communicate better in the future. Too many people want us to fail and are willing to twist any bit of news against Tesla.

6125,"However, China's real estate crisis will explode in a way that makes ours look puny. They can't hide it for much longer."
6126,"Yeah, will be great for the American economy & jobs, as we've mostly dealt with the overbuilt housing crisis."
6127,"My first prediction of has come true: ouch, my head hurts."

6140,Interesting Economist article about how humanity's collective actions have created a fundamentally new geological age -- the Anthropocene.
6141,"Cool personal essay. It really resonated with me, as I felt the same way after coming very close to dying from malaria ten years ago."
6142,"Liked ""Screw Business as Usual"" a lot. This approach should be taken to heart by all, as it really is the smart move."

6146,Walked around a neighborhood recently rebuilt with help from APJ and others
6147,"It was Xmas, so we brought presents for the kids at the orphanage. They don't usually get much."
6148,"Met with UNICEF, Doctors Without Borders and Artists for Peace & Justice. I support them and would recommend others do too."
6149,Just returned from a trip to Haiti. Covered a lot of ground and saw many tough situations. They need a lot of help.

6160,"Got called randomly by Kanye West today and received a download of his thoughts, ranging from shoes to Moses. He was polite, but opaque."
6161,His singing and acting talent will be sorely missed: South Park sequel coming soon...
6162,Why does the crowd cry over the glorious leader Kim Il Sung's death? Fear of being shot may play a role:
6163,Sam Harris also wrote a nice piece on the awesomeness of Hitchens: May the good man RIP.
6164,"Read ""Lying"", the new book by my friend Sam Harris. Excellent cover art and lots of good reasons not to lie!"
6165,Am reading a great biography of Ben Franklin by Isaacson. Highly recommended.
6166,That was a total non sequitur btw

6173,Excited to have Larry Ellison &amp; Kathleen Wilson-Thompson join the Tesla board!
6174,Ok
6175,Tesla team did a great job!
6176,Yes
6177,I will provide a detailed explanation in March/April
6178,Time. Although it also turned out to be dramatically better.
6179,Exactly
6180,Yes
6181,Probability at % &amp; rising rapidly due to new architecture
6182,Congratulations
6183,Coming soon
6184,Yes
6185,Got it
6186,"Definitely. All major highways in Texas will have Superchargers, all the way to Brownsville &amp; across Mexico."
6187,Yep
6188,Yes
6189,"Yes. Supercharger coverage will extend to % of Europe next year. From Ireland to Kiev, from Norway to Turkey."
6190,"Most people dont know that the Tesla Supercharger network allows easy long distance travel throughout USA, most of Europe, Canada and China"
6191,We are dramatically increasing Tesla Superchargers within cities &amp; working with landlords to add home charging to apartment buildings
6192,Ok
6193,Wow!
6194,"This is incorrect. Vast majority of vehicle motion is returned to the battery, as the electric motors act like a generator in reverse. Brake pads on a Tesla literally never need to be replaced for lifetime of the car."
6195,"Most importantly, every electric car, Tesla or otherwise, matters to the environment we all share. Every time someone chooses electric, the future gets a little bit brighter! If not Tesla, please take a look at these other options:"
6196,"And, because electricity costs much less than gasoline, a Model can cost about $1000 less per year to operate. Because its electric, there are no oil changes, smog checks, tuneups, fuel filter, or brake pad replacements."
6197,"There are also many state &amp; local incentives, for example California offers $2500, plus $800 from utilities &amp; access to carpool lane, Colorado $4000, etc"
6198,Reminder to US buyers that the $7500 tax credit cuts in half in days! Order online at to see if there is any inventory left in your region or visit Tesla stores.
6199,Merry Christmas &amp; goodwill to all!!
6200,"No, Raptors must be shielded during atmospheric entry. Although, maybe not ..."
6201,"Thanks, hope you have a good holiday! Your insight on autonomy is excellent."
6202,Sigh
6203,Yes
6204,"Leeward side needs nothing, windward side will be activity cooled with residual (cryo) liquid methane, so will appear liquid silver even on hot side"
6205,Glad youre ok!
6206,Starship will look like liquid silver
6207,Haha
6208,Maybe
6209,Much less
6210,Skin will get too hot for paint. Stainless mirror finish. Maximum relfectivity.
6211,"Usable strength/weight of full hard stainless at cryo is slightly better than carbon fiber, room temp is worse, high temp is vastly better"
6212,"Yes, signal acquired from that dish"
6213,Stainless Steel Starship
6214,Which seems to be the approximate pixel size of reality
6215,When its no longer noticeable over Plancks length
6216,Yes! People are almost always surprised to learn that Earths gravitational reach is infinite. Zero gravity is achieved by zooming around Earth super fast until outward acceleration equals inward acceleration of gravity.
6217,At SpaceX Boca Chica launch site in Texas
6218,Amazing space progress by China. This year they did more orbital launches than the USA for the first time.
6219,Engineering is true magic
6220,Yezzz
6221,How bizarre. Sorry to hear that.
6222,Putting in little outward-facing speakers would open up a lot of opportunities
6223,Please put invented car fart on my gravestone. This is my only request.
6224,Our superalloy foundry is now almost fully operational. This allows rapid iteration on Raptor.
6225,"SpaceX metallurgy team developed SX500 superalloy for psi, hot oxygen-rich gas. It was hard. Almost any metal turns into a flare in those conditions."
6226,Thanks!
6227,"Its embarrassing that Boeing/Lockheed need to use a Russian engine on Atlas, but that engine design is brilliant"
6228,You def dont want electric pumps on a rocket engine! Raptor turbopumps alone need horsepower per engine. Thats not a typo.
6229,"Yes, full flow, gas-gas, staged combustion. Will take us time to work up to bar. That is a mad level."
6230,Yes. Radically redesigned Raptor ready to fire next month.
6231,"Seriously! We are just on the wrong planet for SSTO. Mars, no problem."
6232,"Starlink V1 on Falcon, V2+ on Starship. Basically, all future products will contain either the word star or link"
6233,"Yes, but single stage to orbit with no payload is pointless. Add Super Heavy rocket booster &amp; orbital payload is gigantic. Only need booster on Earth, due to deep gravity well &amp; thick atmosphere. Starship alone on moons &amp; Mars."
6234,Coldformed at cryo
6235,"This test hopper is at full body diameter of m / ft, just not full height. Super Heavy will be full height &amp; diameter."
6236,Were building subsections of the Starship Mk I orbital design there
6237,Exactly
6238,"For sheet/plate, at supplier made to our spec. For cast, in our Hawthorne foundry."
6239,Yes
6240,"I will do a full technical presentation of Starship after the test vehicle were building in Texas flies, so hopefully March/April"
6241,"Yup. Actually, the only significant design element in common with early Atlas is stainless steel &amp; were using a different alloy mix. I super Series Stainless!"
6242,"While there are some material similarities, Starship is very different from the Atlas design"
6243,"Stainless steel is correct, but different mixture of alloys &amp; new architecture. Unlike Atlas, Starship is buckling stable on launchpad even when unpressurized."
6244,"If Tesla committed delivery &amp; customer made good faith efforts to receive before year end, Tesla will cover the tax credit difference"
6245,Coming soon
6246,"It will be tight, but Tesla production should have all mid-range Model orders delivered by year end"
6247,Try connecting to WiFi
6248,"Tesla has released all cars for sale where original customer cant take delivery before year end, as well as test drive / display cars, which cost less. Reminder to US buyers that $7500 tax credit drops in half in days. Order online at or visit stores."
6249,Only if Dawkins joins
6250,Interesting
6251,Bajirao Mastani
6252,"Anxiety is a scalar, fear is a vector"
6253,Yes
6254,Haha
6255,Namaste
6256,Needs a warmup
6257,Must feel amazing up there in microgravity zooming around the Earth every minutes! Hope you have a Merry Christmas!
6258,"Thanks, will consider next year"
6259,"So long as the tunnels are spaced about one diameter apart, most of the stress will flow around them, but this wont matter for the first few layers"
6260,Tesla phone app release next week will enable service scheduling in mins with a few taps. No more need to call!
6261,"As a thank you to Tesla short sellers, we named a after them haha"
6262,"Perhaps lost in the transport debate is that built a ft tunnel in LA for ~$10M with V1 (Godot). Next tunnel will be made with V2 (Line-Storm). V3 (Prufrock), aspirationally X better, should be operational next year. For reference:"
6263,Join our underground movement!
6264,"Reverse back down (using same roller guide wheels, so no skill required) &amp; tow or flatbed it out"
6265,Ok
6266,Autopilot doesnt need the guide wheels. Theyre only there if there is a complete system failure. Turns will definitely be banked in future.
6267,Are tunnels safe in an earthquake?
6268,Exactly
6269,"The guides are basically just a wheel, a shock absorber &amp; a solenoid. Costs a few hundred dollars in volume."
6270,"Yeah, it would allow many streets to become parks and walking areas. Less concrete, more trees."
6271,"Probably only need three types: straight ramp, spiral ramp &amp; elevator. Latter only for tight spaces."
6272,"Passive lateral safety is required by regulators &amp; I think theyre right. Might be able to build this into the tunnel wall though. So long as the vehicle is prevented by physics from rolling or jackknifing, there is probably a good safety argument."
6273,"Youre right. We did have a sim ready, but it was confusing, so I didnt include it. Were working on one that makes things clear."
6274,"Pop up, park and walk!"
6275,I know that area well. Best would be to add ramps into the tunnel system from the basement levels of the parking lots surrounding rd St.
6276,"If all vehicles were densely seated buses, throughput in excess of people per hour per lane is possible, but better to offer a range of vehicles &amp; let people decide what makes them happy"
6277,"A variety of vehicles, like normal roads, from a small car to a densely seated bus. Must be seated &amp; belted for high speed safety."
6278,Next step for Loop is demonstrating high throughput at high speed. Target is vehicles/hour at mph (250km/h).
6279,Precisely
6280,Presentation starting at :15
6281,"This *is* affordable mass transit, but better in that it takes you where and when you to go"
6282,"The demo ride takes you in *same* car on road, down elevator, zips through tunnel using guide wheels, up elevator at destination &amp; then drives on normal roads back to start"
6283,"Actually way more capacity, way faster &amp; way more convenient. Subways are fine, but its time to upgrade to something better."
6284,All Boring Loops will include continuously circulating cars dedicated to pedestrians &amp; cyclists
6285,"Capable of traveling safely at over mph. At that speed, it will feel like teleporting within a city."
6286,Yes
6287,"This can be applied to any autonomous, electric vehicle, not just Tesla"
6288,Tesla in tunnel with retractable wheel gear that turns a car into a rail-guided train &amp; back again
6289,Boring product launch will be streamed live at pm California time tonight
6290,Boring is developing an entirely new system of transport
6291,Same applies to those who didnt order PUP
6292,Exactly. Its a good way to go. Get people with more money to pay for the development!
6293,"Yeah, I wrote that back in , almost years ago!"
6294,"Clayton is wrong. New tech is always expensive. Tech disruption occurs at *high end*, eg computers &amp; cell phones. It takes many design iterations &amp; vast economies of scale to achieve mass market affordability."
6295,Honored to work with amazing teams at SpaceX &amp; Tesla!
6296,Totally false. Buried in this incredibly misleading WSJ article is the actual statement from Thiels Founders Fund: we have no concerns whatsoever.
6297,"Same facts, same period of time, but extremely different reporting"
6298,Tis
6299,Medieval Futurism
6300,Tesla app almost done. Important to get every note right!
6301,Thanks!
6302,The white seats are actually extremely stain resistant. You can spill red wine on the seats &amp; just wipe it off.
6303,Congratulations!
6304,"In other words, you may be able to get a Tesla before the $7500 US tax credit drops in weeks, even if you havent placed an order yet"
6305,You got it
6306,Pretty good. I have confirmation turned off on my engineering build &amp; interventions are rare. Probably ready to enable no confirmation setting next month.
6307,Zero Suit
6308,God Fire
6309,ramen is sooo good
6310,Exactly
6311,This part is true. I was trying to explain that we dont want our cars to have a tinny sound.
6312,You should def have a loaner. Will take care of it.
6313,Seems likely that well be able to reuse fairings that soft-landed in the ocean. May not need net at all. Would still love to see the catch happen though
6314,"Incorrect. Chairman is an honorific, not executive role, which means its not needed to run Tesla. Will retire that title at Tesla in years. Mins edited out end of my sentence, where I said I could do whatever I want. They cut provided I have the support of shareholders."
6315,About to days
6316,"Also, Tesla policy is that if you order a car without a test drive you get days to return for full refund vs day if you do get a test drive (resources are overbooked)"
6317,"Important note for US Tesla buyers: Federal tax credit drops by $3750 in weeks. To be on the cancellation waitlist for delivery this year or if you want a display car, order at or visit our stores. Full refund if Tesla cant deliver your car this year."
6318,No need to wait. Its super easy to swap the HW2 and HW3 computers. Sensors are the same.
6319,Im dying to make a pickup truck so bad we might have a prototype to unveil next year
6320,Yes
6321,"Love that people are buying a Tesla for the product itself, even if they dont believe in climate change. Not everyone can be convinced about global warming, but if an electric car is simply the best product, they dont need to be."
6322,Probably next month
6323,Youre right. There was a ton of footage with many people at Tesla that would be great to share. Longer pieces like we did with tell a more interesting story.
6324,"Were opening a lot of Tesla service centers next year, including Knoxville. Tesla will post upcoming city opening map this week."
6325,Probably end of next year
6326,So true
6327,This is a very misleading edit. Please post the full transcript where I complete the sentence.
6328,"Mins actually had several hours of interview time, which they distilled to mins. Many stories could been told with that time. This was accurate as viewed from an Upper East Side Manhattan dinner party."
6329,We are awaiting EU regulatory approval for this release
6330,"Full self-driving option is required with the Tesla designed hardware computer. This is a simple plug in replacement for the NVidia computer, but has over X the image processing ability."
6331,"Already testing traffic lights, stop signs &amp; roundabouts in development software. Your Tesla will soon be able to go from your garage at home to parking at work with no driver input at all."
6332,"If you have a Tesla built in past years, definitely try Navigate on Autopilot. It will blow your mind. Automatically passes slow cars &amp; takes highway interchanges &amp; off-ramps."
6333,Machete!!
6334,"It was supposed to be, but that was a dumb decision. In the end, Roadster only had % of parts in common with the Lotus Elise or any other car."
6335,"Major credit to AC Propulsion for the tzero electric sports car -2003 that inspired Tesla Roadster. Without that, Tesla wouldnt exist or would have started much later."
6336,"Yeah, we wanted to name our company after Tesla, the great scientist/engineer, but use of the Tesla name in automotive was already trademarked in the US, Europe &amp; later China."
6337,"Buying took over a decade, $11M &amp; amazing amount of effort. Didnt like even when we were only making ."
6338,"Tesla history trivia: we didnt actually come up with the Tesla Motors name. Bought trademark off Brad Siewert for $75k in late . Hed originally filed for it in . Our alternative name was Faraday, which was used by a competitor several years later."
6339,"Both, but demo Starship is being built now, whereas Super Heavy hardware will start getting built in spring"
6340,But cool pics of the demo Starship that will fly suborbital hops coming in ~4 weeks
6341,Yes
6342,Interesting
6343,"Fairly heavy metal, but extremely strong"
6344,The new design is metal
6345,"As far as we know, its the largest single piece titanium casting in the world. Major improvement over the old aluminum grid fins, as the titanium doesnt need heat shielding or even paint."
6346,Boring Company product launch on Dec . More than a tunnel opening. Will include modded but fully road legal autonomous transport cars &amp; ground to tunnel car elevators.
6347,Tracking shot of Falcon water landing
6348,"Engines stabilized rocket spin just in time, enabling an intact landing in water! Ships en route to rescue Falcon."
6349,"Pump is single string. Some landing systems are not redundant, as landing is considered ground safety critical, but not mission critical. Given this event, we will likely add a backup pump &amp; lines."
6350,We may use it for an internal SpaceX mission
6351,"Yes, cutaway was a mistake. We will show all footage, good or bad."
6352,"Grid fin hydraulic pump stalled, so Falcon landed just out to sea. Appears to be undamaged &amp; is transmitting data. Recovery ship dispatched."
6353,Falcon/Dragon launch to in minutes
6354,Us too sigh
6355,"Falcon fairing halves missed the net, but touched down softly in the water. Mr Steven is picking them up. Plan is to dry them out &amp; launch again. Nothing wrong with a little swim."
6356,satellites on this flight!
6357,"Were adding police car, fire truck &amp; ambulance to the Tesla neural net in coming months"
6358,"Exactly. Default Autopilot behavior, if theres no driver input, is to slow gradually to a stop &amp; turn on hazard lights. Tesla service then contacts the owner. Looking into what happened here."
6359,It is so hard to move in armor!
6360,Youre all hired!
6361,Yes no maybe
6362,None shall pass!
6363,Ok
6364,Good advice
6365,Applying a hydrophobic coating to the radar (located just below nose of car) should help. Easy to do yourself or Tesla service can do it. Were also working on vision-only driving.
6366,Glad youre ok
6367,"Perhaps most telling is that Norway, which is partly above the Arctic Circle, has more Teslas per capita than any other country on Earth."
6368,"As the battery warms up, almost all of that is recovered. There is a roughly % range loss for cabin heating. Cabin heating impact on range is higher in slow traffic, but range is also higher in slow traffic."
6369,"Incoming rocket &amp; fairing probably visible, but landing itself is over the horizon"
6370,You got it!
6371,"Three things, one of which is CH4"
6372,No
6373,No
6374,"Reentry scorchmarks, not simple soot. Cant wipe it off."
6375,Haha
6376,"Prof Dahn is correct (hes great), but the relative benefit is small. Id recommend % more SoC for convenience."
6377,"Not worth going below % imo. Even % is still fine. Also, no issue going to % or lower SoC."
6378,True
6379,Both
6380,Your Tesla can function as a boat for brief periods of time
6381,One day
6382,"Were doing an EIR for the greater LA tunnel network. Thought we might need a N-S test tunnel (hence Sepulveda proposal), but were just going to do rock core samples along that corridor instead."
6383,Update soon
6384,Sorry
6385,Boring breakthrough
6386,Definitely
6387,"After safety, our goal is to make a Tesla the most fun you could possibly have in a car"
6388,We tried. Nintendo wont license it to us.
6389,That would be cool
6390,Haha kinda true
6391,Never heard of it
6392,"Super fun software Easter eggs coming to all Tesla S/3/X cars before the holidays! Romance mode, toilet humor &amp; more video games."
6393,Software upgrade to rain sensing neural net coming next month
6394,Yes
6395,"This is completely backwards. Based on what weve learned from the Hawthorne test tunnel, were moving forward with a much larger tunnel network under LA. Wont need a second test tunnel under Sepulveda."
6396,"Cool! Actually, if you buy a Tesla without a test drive, you have days to return it. If you buy after a test drive, you still have hours. Trying to incent buying with no test drive."
6397,Tiny wizard
6398,to years
6399,"Engineers, artists &amp; creators of all kinds. There is so much to build."
6400,Touch
6401,"But if you love what you do, it (mostly) doesnt feel like work"
6402,"Varies per person, but about sustained, peaking above at times. Pain level increases exponentially above ."
6403,"There are way easier places to work, but nobody ever changed the world on hours a week"
6404,"Join to create exciting new worlds of technology!! If getting things done matters to you, then , , &amp; are the places to be."
6405,Congratulations! What an amazing track record of success with Mars!
6406,liters of pure water costs $1
6407,"For those worried about running out of fresh water, it may help to know that desalination only costs cents per liter or half a cent per gallon"
6408,Ah yes fair point
6409,"Used to live in Silicon Valley, now I live in Silicone Valley"
6410,Not yet
6411,trouble
6412,Earth is
6413,"Earths crust is only ~1% of Earth mass, so technically we should be called Lava"
6414,"Earth should be called Water. Our surface is % water. Mars land area is roughly equal to Earth, as its all land. Even when warmed up &amp; water ice turns liquid, Mars will be about /3 land."
6415,"Yeah, good idea to offer that as a setting"
6416,"Contour remains approx same, but fundamental materials change to airframe, tanks &amp; heatshield"
6417,"If you dont want a Tesla, heres a list of all electric cars in North America via"
6418,Signing off for a while
6419,Happy Thanksgiving!!
6420,Starships were meant to fly
6421,Starship Tooters
6422,Good one
6423,Good idea
6424,Coming soon
6425,Shifting resources from sales to service for next several days
6426,Should be next week
6427,"No, its the first or boost stage, analogous to, but much larger than Falcon"
6428,Later versions will
6429,"Technically, two parts: Starship is the spaceship/upper stage &amp; Super Heavy is the rocket booster needed to escape Earths deep gravity well (not needed for other planets or moons)"
6430,Renaming BFR to Starship
6431,"No, were just going to accelerate BFR"
6432,Yes
6433,"Supercharger V3, which starts rolling out early next year, will also charge much faster"
6434,Tesla Supercharger capacity will double by end of next year. Expect to be within range of % to % of population in all active markets.
6435,"No, its got enough load capacity &amp; volume to carry the battery pack &amp; our current pack energy density is about double that of original Roadster. Still, it would probably only save about % to % of effort, all things considered."
6436,"In order of resource priority, but not necessarily production ramp, as that depends on thousands of parts &amp; processes, which are extremely difficult to forecast"
6437,"What really matters is time to volume production, not initial market intro. Apart from brief moments, Tesla vehicle production is limited by total battery output."
6438,"Lot on our plate, so its either get van gliders (no battery, powertrain or compute tech) from Daimler &amp; produce sooner or do all &amp; produce later. Not a big difference to total vehicles produced either way. Priority list is Model Y, solar roof tiles, pickup, semi, Roadster."
6439,Ok
6440,Maybe interesting to work with Daimler/Mercedes on an electric Sprinter. Thats a great van. We will inquire.
6441,Absolutely agree
6442,Investigating
6443,Probably mid
6444,Tesla can provide heating/cooling/lights/music for days using battery
6445,"Not everywhere, but should be possible around major metros. Parts supply chain to UK should be fixed. Lmk if not."
6446,Should be possible. Please ask service &amp; lmk response.
6447,"No, but perhaps in a few years"
6448,"Yeah, good idea. We have that state internally, so can push data to phone app."
6449,"Haha, just like Super Troopers"
6450,Ideal situation in breakdown/accident (assuming no injuries) is that Tesla arrives at scene fast with top-of-the-line service loaner
6451,Will allow having your car picked up &amp; dropped off or using mobile Tesla Rangers service vans if car lift isnt needed
6452,Adding functionality to Tesla phone app allowing owners to request service for top issues with or taps
6453,"Yes, no upgrades planned for F9. Minor tweaks to improve reliability only, provided NASA &amp; USAF are supportive."
6454,Radical change
6455,"Btw, SpaceX is no longer planning to upgrade Falcon second stage for reusability. Accelerating BFR instead. New design is very exciting! Delightfully counter-intuitive."
6456,It will alert Tesla service automatically as fan power required to achieve target pressure drop exceeds spec level
6457,"Set air flow to recirculating mode &amp; manually raise blower speed to in Model for best air quality. Air filters are smaller than S/X, so clear air is achieved by circulating through filter several times."
6458,Congratulations on completing the LA/Hawthorne tunnel! Cutting edge technology!
6459,Boring Company just broke through the other side!!
6460,Missed miku concert sigh
6461,Listening to Better Now
6462,"China, especially, is doing an amazing job moving towards sustainable energy generation &amp; transport"
6463,"Sure hope this isnt true. It is the non-linearities, such as Siberian permafrost melting or ocean currents changing, that are most difficult to predict."
6464,Haha
6465,Looking back at the sun from upper stage &amp; Falcon landed on drone ship Of Course I Still Love You
6466,$5 per min to argue with knight. $12 for min bulk discount.
6467,While (!castle) {brick++};
6468,Watchtower (feat. knight) will be at LA/Hawthorne tunnel entrance
6469,Fortnite irl
6470,Boring Co is launching a whole product line of DIY watchtowers. You get bricks &amp; a picture.
6471,"Um, that is not our castle. I just found a picture on the Internet."
6472,Not much but it is ours
6473,The Boring Company is building a watchtower in LA out of dirt bricks &amp; we need a knight to yell insults at people in a French accent
6474,"We have to truck to departure rail head &amp; truck from arrival rail head, which is usually from customers. Car gets moved around rail yard a lot too &amp; trains dont leave often."
6475,"Probably some deliveries in March, but April is more certain"
6476,Yes
6477,"Will also be using dedicated roll-on, roll-off fast ships for transporting cars to Europe &amp; Asia in Q1. Major focus on minimizing time from factory to new owner. Did not fully appreciate the working capital impact until recently."
6478,We bought some trucking companies &amp; secured contracts with major haulers to avoid trucking shortage mistake of last quarter
6479,Probably technically able to do so in about a year. Then up to regulators.
6480,"Skipping rail saves over a month for East Coast deliveries. All things considered, its better to use trucks. Single load/unload &amp; direct to owner location."
6481,Tesla just acquired trucking capacity to ensure Model can be delivered in US by Dec if ordered by Nov
6482,We will fight Big Tequila!
6483,That would be awesome
6484,Easily accessible energy
6485,Send me a note!
6486,Would be fun to add to Tesla
6487,Yes
6488,Will try again next month
6489,"Congratulations team! Thanks , much appreciated."
6490,"Rest in peace, Stan Lee. The many worlds of imagination &amp; delight you created for humanity will last forever."
6491,Is he ok?
6492,"It naturally follows that a hotter system will have more energetic events. For example, as a pot of water becomes colder, it becomes inert ice, but heating a pot of water turns it into a steam boiler."
6493,Scary sign of times to come. It will get worse.
6494,"Agreed, technically, mined hydrocarbons come primarily from ancient, decayed marine organisms &amp; partially from geological processes (CH4 particularly)"
6495,"Makes me so mad when smart, ethical scientists I know are accused of publishing climate papers for grant money. They earn vs their other opportunities, but give that up to help world. But their accusers make billions by slowing down clean energy. Which is more credible?"
6496,"That is true &amp; should be applauded. Right move is for oil companies truly to think of themselves as energy companies, but move rapidly towards clean, sustainable energy. Means lower profits short-term, but will make them stronger long-term."
6497,"We know well run out of dead dinosaurs to mine for fuel &amp; have to use sustainable energy eventually, so why not go renewable now &amp; avoid increasing risk of climate catastrophe? Betting that science is wrong &amp; oil companies are right is the dumbest experiment in history by far"
6498,Because people on the ground know more about whats actually needed than politicians do
6499,"Good, but not hospital grade. S &amp; X were designed to be proof against an actual bioweapon attack. Requires a giant filter with separate acid &amp; alkaline gas neutralization layers. Not enough room in Model ."
6500,"If Tesla can help people in California wildfire, please let us know. Model S &amp; X have hospital grade HEPA filters. Maybe helpful for transporting people."
6501,"Fair point, will reenable"
6502,"Agreed, top priority for Autopilot team. Being cautious for max safety."
6503,Please lmk what youd most like improved/fixed about your Tesla. Thanks!
6504,Cool
6505,"With similar track wheels/tires/brakes, Model S P100D is faster"
6506,Yes
6507,Would like to thank Robyn for joining the team. Great respect. Very much look forward to working together.
6508,"No, were building a BFR dev ship to do supersonic through landing tests in Boca Chica, Texas"
6509,Wont land propulsively for those reasons. Ultra light heat shield &amp; high Mach control surfaces are what we cant test well without orbital entry. I think we have a handle on propulsive landings.
6510,Aiming for orbital flight by June
6511,Mod to SpaceX tech tree build: Falcon second stage will be upgraded to be like a mini-BFR Ship
6512,But comments are
6513,LA/Hawthorne demonstration tunnel activates Dec . Runs parallel to freeway from Crenshaw Blvd to .
6514,"I think Twitter is deleting fake, scam or maybe even inactive accounts. My follower count decreased by ~20k over the past few days."
6515,"Sure, we can do it"
6516,Zeroth Law

6522,Remember the future
6523,Oh hi guys lol
6524,"Yes, Germany has outstanding engineering talent"
6525,"Just a few mins, which is mostly accelerating &amp; decelerating"
6526,So underappreciated
6527,Ok
6528,Ok
6529,Walked full length of Boring Co tunnel under LA tonight. Disturbingly long. On track for opening party Dec . Will be very one-dimensional.
6530,"Sounds like pure luxury! When I said sponge, I was actually speaking metaphorically. Truth is, I was just a simple nucleotide, drifting alone in small crevice with trillion siblings."
6531,What is love?
6532,Bikini Bottom
6533,Fair
6534,"Yes, that is how"
6535,We didnt even have kids back then. Just little sponges.
6536,Sea sponge. Humans would later use our bodies to clean dishes. So humiliating.
6537,Wow thats cool!
6538,Kids these days have it easy
6539,I remember when I was a sponge. Simpler times they were.
6540,Haha
6541,First movie I ever saw in theaters
6542,When the only existing life was a sponge
6543,Although it was in the precambrian era
6544,Star Wars only had an $11M budget. Must have been in the galaxy of ridiculously low budgets.
6545,Theyre great! Honored to work with them.
6546,Yes
6547,Definitely
6548,"Aspirationally, they will be made to the exact same specification, but we can vary cell quantity to account for empirical variation"
6549,"Hopefully, partial presence in India, Africa &amp; South America end of next year, with broader expansion in"
6550,"Recently asked service team to expand locations to all population regions (not just major metros) in North America, Eastern Europe, China &amp; Japan by end of next year. We are completely missing vast geographic regions in some cases."
6551,"To clarify further, the long-term goal for Tesla mass market products is local production for local markets (at least at the continent level). This is critical to make pricing as affordable as possible."
6552,"Tesla will manufacture all battery modules &amp; packs at China Giga, as we do today in California &amp; Nevada. Cell production will be sourced locally, most likely from several companies (incl Pana), in order to meet demand in a timely manner."
6553,"Amazing results by at Tesla Gigafactory Nevada! Very much appreciate extreme hard work it took to achieve this result. Together with Pana Japan cell plants, Tesla/Pana partnership is producing ~60% of global EV battery output!"
6554,Prob to weeks
6555,v true
6556,cute
6557,Haha
6558,Bring Me the Horizon
6559,Aiming for next week
6560,Norway
6561,"r wrong, but in Tesla makes s overseas &amp; East Coast in st half of quarter"
6562,"Long-term, the car will work purely on vision, with radar just a plus, but maybe worth adding a radar heater anyway"
6563,We can make it work from very far away. LoS is just for safety.
6564,Hahaha &lt;ahem&gt;
6565,Um yes
6566,"Maybe AI will make me follow it, laugh like a demon &amp; say whos the pet now"
6567,"Also, youll be able to drive it from your phone remotely like a big RC car if in line of sight"
6568,Car will drive to your phone location &amp; follow you like a pet if you hold down summon button on Tesla app
6569,"Tesla advanced Summon ready in ~6 weeks! Just an over-the-air software upgrade, so will work on all cars made in past years (Autopilot hardware V2+)."
6570,Scientists uncover Sneaky move by GM
6571,"For those unfamiliar, this uses Tesla Autopark/Summon. Slightly smarter version hopefully ready soon. By next year, a Tesla should be able to drive around a parking lot, find an empty spot, read signs to confirm its valid &amp; park."
6572,Cool haha
6573,"Legally required officers of a corporation are president, treasurer &amp; secretary. Guess I have to keep st one or it will confuse the authorities."
6574,"Good point, might put that one back"
6575,Deleted my Tesla titles last week to see what would happen. Im now the Nothing of Tesla. Seems fine so far.
6576,Signing off Twitter for a few days ...
6577,"Dont worry, well make it right"
6578,The FOIA on this will be solid gold. Cant wait.
6579,Not going up. We will just offer those who ordered bought P either $5k back or free lifetime Supercharging.
6580,"Its a reasonable criticism. We wanted to make the awesome version of Model Performance more affordable, but it was arguably too much too soon. Taking corrective action"
6581,"Exactly, this is total bs. What part of production hell sounds like a sure thing!?"
6582,We will enable track mode for all performance cars
6583,"It was underpriced. Anyway, if you want $5k refund &amp; free Supercharging turned off, we will do that."
6584,"Ok, we will turn off lifetime free Supercharging and give you $5k refund"
6585,"Yeah, or free lifetime Supercharging, whichever you prefer"
6586,Didnt you get free Supercharging for life? Current buyers dont get that.
6587,Exactly. Thats Monday.
6588,"Yes. Will require tapping indicator to confirm at first. When safety looks good after M miles of driving or so, there will be an option to turn off confirm."
6589,"No, but I will"
6590,Isnt it obvious?
6591,Worth it
6592,True
6593,Tesla Autopilot Drive on Navigation going to wide release in North America tonight
6594,"Not exactly. We just bundled the upgrade package into Performance. No problem if you want to return the car, but I think lifetime free Supercharging is a good deal."
6595,Haha
6596,"On Insta, % of followers like even lame posts. On Twitter, good posts get %."
6597,Lacks scale
6598,"Reddit is massive, but def has gems"
6599,"Reddits twitter account is lame, because its not real Reddit"
6600,Exactly
6601,Youre right. Earlier Model Performance buyers got free lifetime Supercharging. Will add that to anyone who bought recently.
6602,"On Twitter, likes are rare &amp; criticism is brutal. So hardcore. Its great."
6603,Glad youre ok
6604,"S is better, but rear seat folds down in Model , so bikes can fit in trunk"
6605,Hey thats my Halloween costume!
6606,Good question
6607,"Clearly, youre not reading my twitter"
6608,I wish
6609,Taking action. Tesla body shops now operating in California aiming for same day body repair in most cases.
6610,Yes Zorbix
6611,"Sir, I would never"
6612,"Yes, I am a little girl. Ok, not that little. Or a girl."
6613,Making progress
6614,I said dankest not darkest omg
6615,im actually cat girl heres selfie rn

6626,Midnight
6627,My twitter feed rn
6628,Then the hell with science!
6629,Not moths tho
6630,Send me ur dankest memes!!
6631,in
6632,Fresh puro from my meme dealer
6633,Exactly. There are many states where we are not allowed to sell cars at all or are severely restricted to literally one store.
6634,"Model was top-selling car in US by revenue despite no advertising, no paid endorsements &amp; no discounts. Competitors spent billions on marketing. Model was product alone."
6635,Massive thanks to Tesla owners &amp; supporters. We wouldnt be here without you.
6636,Same
6637,Howd they know!?
6638,Around mid
6639,"There have been hundreds of improvements to fit &amp; finish over the years, but no major step change in this regard. Seats, especially, are dramatically better now than in the past."
6640,Only thing almost anyone would notice is the nose
6641,Just did that to correct the front design esthetic of Model S. The nose of an electric car shouldnt look like a radiator grill opening.
6642,"Get this question a lot, so need to clarify that theres no such thing as a Tesla refresh. Other car companies do this every ~3 years, but Tesla constantly upgrades vehicle hardware every week."
6643,"To simplify production, many Tesla Model S &amp; X interior configs, will no longer be available after Nov . Order now to be sure of the one you want."
6644,"Model body design could def be less complex, but, yes, most of weight difference is due to higher safety vs other cars"
6645,Working on it
6646,That is correct
6647,Twitter thought I got hacked &amp; locked my account haha
6648,Wanna buy some Bitcoin?
6649,And I own a chibi Wolverine
6650,ianime
6651,"Order Tesla without test drive &amp; you get days to return for refund, else day"
6652,Former
6653,Will be in next point release
6654,"Hopefully, a few months for Drive on Navigation capability. We need to address differences in how lane lines are painted. Varies greatly by country."
6655,Good point
6656,Interesting
6657,"This is a ~ ft demo tunnel. First operational, high-speed tunnel still set for Chicago, pending regulatory approvals."
6658,Under LA (Hawthorne)
6659,mph | km/h
6660,Opening event that night &amp; free rides for the public next day
6661,"Pretty close, actually"
6662,I think real
6663,Opens Dec
6664,The first tunnel is almost done
6665,N00B!
6666,Twitter is Dark Souls of social media. Reddit is Bloodborne. Insta is Zelda.
6667,Good idea!
6668,"This game is my personal favorite, but I am biased towards space stuff"
6669,Coming soon
6670,Turn on enhanced security via the settings page. This will require entering a passcode to use the car.
6671,Digital Style!
6672,Would I really let someone get away with using my name all this time?
6673,BoredElonMusk is my secret troll account. Its time people knew.
6674,"No, bored me, I will not"
6675,Maybe phone as controller
6676,Exactly
6677,Coming
6678,Yes
6679,Reality is hard
6680,Online doesnt count
6681,Coming soon
6682,No
6683,Thats next
6684,Had to been done ur welcome
6685,I hope this is true!
6686,"If you dont like a Tesla for any reason or no reason, you can just give it back for a full refund"
6687,Also available off menu for a week. Was causing too much confusion.
6688,"Model long range, rear wheel drive is still available for ordering off menu for another week or so"
6689,"Its kind of like the post office. Same price for delivery to Maine as the SF Bay Area. But you do get a free Tesla factory tour, which is really fun to see."
6690,"Tesla rear wheel drive cars do actually work well on snow &amp; ice. We did our traction testing on an ice lake! Dual motor AWD is great, but not required for cold weather. Just dont use sport/summer tires."
6691,"Its a long range battery with fewer cells. Non-cell portion of the pack is disproportionately high, but we can get it done now instead of ~February"
6692,"Just released lower cost, mid-range Tesla Model &amp; super simple new order page"
6693,Week or two
6694,Love the Reddit comments too
6695,Dog saves her puppies
6696,y
6697,Youll see
6698,Tomorrow brings a lemur
6699,Special Circumstances
6700,Yes
6701,New Summon will use the Autopilot cameras
6702,"Yes, aiming for next few months"
6703,"True, but this will improve dramatically over next several months &amp; all Tesla cars ever produced (except early Roadsters) will get improvements for free. Continuous, free over-the-air software updates is a big part of why a Tesla retains so much value over time."
6704,Same goes for all countries within which we officially operate by end of next year
6705,Just reviewed Teslas service locations in North America &amp; realized we have major gaps in geographic coverage! Sorry for this foolish oversight. Tesla will aim to cover all regions of NA (not just big cities) within to months.
6706,Insightful article by David
6707,"Thanks John, really admire you too! I think youre one of the best engineers ever. Hope you return to working on rockets one day."
6708,The FSD upgrade is the Tesla computer with our NN chip
6709,I believe its $5k
6710,~6 months before it is in all new production cars. No change to sensors. This is simple replacement of the Autopilot computer. Will be done free of charge for those who ordered full self-driving.
6711,Somewhere between % &amp; %
6712,"To be clear, actual NN improvement is significantly overestimated in this article. V9.0 vs V8.1 is more like a ~400% increase in useful ops/sec due to enabling integrated GPU &amp; better use of discrete GPU."
6713,"This is without the Tesla NN computer. Per my public comments, that will give the car an extra order of magnitude."
6714,Still a long way to go
6715,Model motor &amp; gearbox still in good condition after driving M miles. Designed for ultra high endurance.
6716,Works best if you play games full screen &amp; use steering wheel scroller balls for control
6717,Haha. It is actually my fav game on Tesla cars right now
6718,What are some of the most fun games we could have on a Tesla? Classic Atari is just the start.
6719,Yes
6720,Thanks for recognizing the great work of the Tesla team! people now.
6721,It is time to create a mecha
6722,NERV
6723,&lt;ahem&gt; Elon-chan
6724,Great. Also love Princess Mononoke.
6725,Love Your Name
6726,Maybe this could be part of a (safe) car version of Pokmon Go style game
6727,Towelie
6728,Good idea!
6729,Whole beer keg fits in Model trunk!
6730,"Wow, mechanical logic gates"
6731,Comes with free towels. Nothing more useful in the entire Universe.
6732,Maybe wise to bring it just in case
6733,About half my money is intended to help problems on Earth &amp; half to help establish a self-sustaining city on Mars to ensure continuation of life (of all species) in case Earth gets hit by a meteor like the dinosaurs or WW3 happens &amp; we destroy ourselves
6734,You should ask why I would want money. The reason is not what you think. Very little time for recreation. Dont have vacation homes or yachts or anything like that.
6735,Yes
6736,"Tesla exists to help reduce risk of catastrophic climate change, which affects all species on Earth. Even if your faith in humanity is faltering, this is worth caring about. Support makes a difference. Thank you."

6738,Teslaquila coming soon
6739,Glad youre safe
6740,Beautiful picture
6741,"Yes, its hard to find. Not sure why."
6742,"Exactly. A Tesla is objectively much safer in a crash than all other cars, according to NHTSAs *own* calculations. This is just physics!"
6743,This is incorrect
6744,At Falcon LZ-1 Vandenberg on Sunday night with the Base Commander. Support of much appreciated.

6748,Because is obviously louder than
6749,No such thing as a full refresh at Tesla or even a model year. Our cars are partially upgraded every month as soon as a new subsystem is ready for production. There is no cadence.
6750,It sure does. Very reliable.
6751,You are right
6752,A reminder of why its important to accelerate advent of cars powered by electricity made from solar power

6766,"Actually, its of forward cameras in rear view mirror assembly. External cameras will auto-activate in future if car is damaged while parked."
6767,Fair point
6768,"When something sounds too good to be true, it usually is. Way the trick works is companies like Blackrock keep up to % of short interest revenue, but suffer almost none of equity decline, as theyre just passive managers. Blackrock made $597M in short lending last year!"
6769,"Not all. However, shorting applied to market as a whole is obv net negative it incents negative gdp! Moreover, it stops private companies from going public, preventing access by retirement funds &amp; small investors, thus increasing wealth divide."
6770,V9 moving to wide release now. Holding back Autopilot drive on navigation for a few more weeks of validation. Extremely difficult to achieve a general solution for self-driving that works well everywhere.

6776,The CIO of a major pension fund is the one who deserves credit for uncovering this scam
6777,"The big funds can &amp; will, as theyre suffering a net loss. Index managers like Blackrock pocket make excessive profit from short lending while pretending to charge low rates for passive index tracking."
6778,"Debatably true, if applied to individual stocks selectively &amp; consciously, but obv false if applied broadly to most of the market &amp; without clear consent of the shareholder"
6779,"Where this breaks down is in passive index funds, which constitute most of the market. The holders of those funds, mostly small investors &amp; retirement funds, dont realize that their stocks are being lent to short sellers, diminishing their true equity return."
6780,"There is no rational basis for a long holder to lend their stock to shorts, as it dilutes the shareholder base &amp; gives the short a strong incentive to attack the company by whatever means possible, including regulators"
6781,I hope to be less wrong over time
6782,Youre most welcome. Hope to do more to help in the future.
6783,What they do should be illegal
6784,The last several years have taught me that they are indeed reasonably maligned
6785,Exactly. Short-sellers are value destroyers. Should definitely be illegal.
6786,"By revenue, taking publicly available selling prices, Model actually outsold Camry by a factor of two"
6787,This is amazing
6788,Almost ready. We expanded the early access program to more users a few days ago.
6789,"People sometimes forget that a company is just a group of people gathered together to make products. So long as it makes great products, it will have great value."
6790,"If you think Tesla is overvalued compared to probable value of future cash flows, sell. Otherwise, buy."
6791,"Hang in there. If you are truly long-term, it will be fine."
6792,True
6793,Sorry about the typo. That was unforgivable. Why would they be upset about their mission? Its what they do.
6794,Just want to that the Shortseller Enrichment Commission is doing incredible work. And the name change is so on point!
6795,Great verdict

6799,Naughty by Nature
6800,Will do. Definitely moving heavily towards direct to work/home delivery of cars!
6801,Tesla will deliver your car to you. This is the future. The way it should work.
6802,That was intense
6803,i
6804,!! Will take action.
6805,And remember
6806,Huge thank you to all Tesla supporters for helping with car deliveries all around the world. You rock!!
6807,Sorry for difficulties delivering your Tesla due to high volume! Critical to show that environmentally sustainable is financially sustainable.
6808,Pace of innovation is all that matters in the long run
6809,Youre welcome. Sorry for the delay!
6810,What would be great is original Elite
6811,Going over final tweaks tonight. Hopefully in wide release end of week.
6812,Tesla Owners
6813,"Increased tire pressure improves range. Also, if you have performance tires, they are stickier. Better handling, but slightly lower range."
6814,"Apologies, were upgrading our logistics system, but running into an extreme shortage of car carrier trailers. Started building our own car carriers this weekend to alleviate load."
6815,Tricky one
6816,"Wow, thanks for offering to help! The coming week is incredibly intense. If any current Tesla owners whod like to help educate new owners could head to Tesla delivery centers during midday on Sat/Sun &amp; morning/evening on weekdays, that would be super appreciated!"
6817,Probably for a base to be built
6818,Mars Base Alpha
6819,"Consider an ice skater. Same weight, but spins/turns much faster with arms in vs arms out. Same principle is true for a car."
6820,"Front vs rear wheel weight distribution, though commonly asked, isn't the right question. You can have % on front, % on rear &amp; still have poor handling if mass elements are far from center. Dumbbell mass distribution is bad, spinning top/dreidel is good."
6821,Simple explanation of polar moment of inertia &amp; other important car terms at
6822,"Key technical point is that the polar moment of inertia (concentration of mass around center) of a Tesla, to the extent of our knowledge, is better than any other production car. This positively affects safety, handling &amp; driving feel. Extremely important metric."
6823,A car propelled by combustion is far more likely to combust than an electric car
6824,"Yes, when it comes to physics, make sure Newton is on your side"
6825,"Helps improve forward crumple zone length, especially important in high speed frontal impacts, and moments of inertia in side impacts"
6826,Tesla piece on the physics of car safety coming soon for those interested in technical details
6827,"Exactly, all star are *not* the same, as the videos show. star just means a car met a certain threshold, but injury probability stats (real numbers) tell you by how much."
6828,Haha true
6829,. will post final safety probability stats soon. Model has a shot at being safest car ever tested.
6830,"Wow, glad theyre ok!"
6831,Physics can be thought of as the compression algorithms of reality
6832,Tesla Rangers!
6833,"engines, but with room to add more down the road. Kinda have to."
6834,"Yes, if there is no listener, a simulation probably wouldnt spend computing power on sound"
6835,Yes
6836,True
6837,"To conserve computing power, a simulation would only render an object when it is observed"
6838,Youre most welcome! Sorry for the delay.
6839,Will do. Love Reddit.
6840,Space Bar
6841,"Long-term, there will be thousands and eventually, hopefully, millions of missions &amp; anyone will be able to go"
6842,"Yeah, Starlink should be active by then"
6843,Sorry! So many bots!!
6844,"Moon mission will be livestreamed in high def VR, so itll feel like youre there in real-time minus a few seconds for speed of light"
6845,Perhaps one of the invited artists choosing to play. There will be no obligation to do so.
6846,Very close
6847,Always
6848,Yes
6849,Thats the first BFR airframe/tank barrel section made of a new carbon fiber material
6850,"Yeah thats exactly how I feel. However it happens, I just hope it does."
6851,Thanks for helping fund a rocket &amp; spaceship that could take humanity beyond Earth!
6852,Hanging out with before the moon mission announcement
6853,Yusaku will be bringing (brave) artists &amp; cultural figures with him on the journey around the moon!
6854,Probably V10 alpha build
6855,"Yes, albeit a beta version. Will improve with V9.1."
6856,Good news on this front. Tesla engineering rallied &amp; this will be part of V9. Going through final testing now.
6857,Thank you for your trust in the team. Greatly appreciated.
6858,Will be interesting to see how this evolves over time
6859,Will see what we can do. Really need to bring this program to an end while being as fair as possible. Its not sustainable long-term.
6860,Very interesting
6861,"Due to some Tesla owners encountering system issues yesterday, the free Supercharging referral program will be extended until tomorrow night"
6862,This is definitely worth thoughtful debate. What might we do differently to improve human/life happiness?
6863,"Yes, I do"
6864,Top SpaceX priority is and will remain supporting crewed spaceflight and National Security missions
6865,"Btw, cant emphasize enough how would not be where it is today without . Thank you."
6866,With lasers
6867,My fav tweet ever
6868,"if you can help get rid of the annoying scam spammers, that would be much appreciated"
6869,Ok
6870,Maybe the scammers will just get tired of winning eventually
6871,"Good catch. They are there in the flight design, but we forgot to put them in this render."
6872,Forward moving wing
6873,"Sorry, weve gone from production hell to delivery logistics hell, but this problem is far more tractable. Were making rapid progress. Should be solved shortly."
6874,Awesome
6875,"Design has been changed so the lands on legs that extend from the tips of the three fins, two of which actuate (mostly for pitch control)"
6876,"Sorry, its not really sustainable at volume production &amp; doesnt incent optimal behavior. We probably should have ended this earlier."
6877,Yes
6878,"Yeah, thats our problem. Service &amp; parts supply in general will be the top Tesla priority after we get through the insane car delivery logistics of the next few weeks."
6879,"Outside repair shops are jack of all trades, which means supporting s of makes &amp; models. Tesla collision repair specializes in three. Having all parts in stock &amp; not waiting for insurance approval also make a world of difference."
6880,Goal is for repaired car to be better than before accident. Should always be true if damaged/used parts are correctly replaced with newer parts.
6881,"Exciting to see some Tesla collision repair operations already completing within hrs. Aiming for same day soon, then under an hour."
6882,"Tesla is bringing most collision repairs in-house, as outside firms take weeks to months for repairs, driving Tesla owners (and us) crazy"
6883,True
6884,"Tesla owners can grant free Supercharging for life to a friend who buys S/3/X. Ends tomorrow night. """
6885,Hi Dustin!
6886,"The Tesla board has done incredible work overseeing the largest value creation in the auto industry in + years, despite many setbacks. Tesla owes its very existence to this board!"
6887,"The muskrat is like a beaver with small ideas, but it has a certain quiet dignity"

6898,Thoughtful feedback
6899,"Due to a large increase in vehicle delivery volume in North America, Tesla customers may experience longer response times. Resolving this is our top priority."
6900,"My apologies, am working on this exact issue right now"
6901,Best show in the multiverse!
6902,"No, service will stock all colors"
6903,"Love that red. We tried every possible way to make red look D without floating a special red tint in primary gloss layer, but no way. We have to stop whole paint shop for red &amp; it looks like an episode of Dexter."
6904,"Moving of Tesla colors off menu on Wednesday to simplify manufacturing. Obsidian Black &amp; Metallic Silver will still be available as special request, but at higher price."
6905,Looks cool
6906,"Not easy coming up with a good cover story for an underground volcano lair, but I think its working"
6907,Test-driving our new boring machine with a

6918,"Am running it in my car, but its not right yet. Hopefully, will release to advanced early access users in a week or two, then more broadly towards end of month."
6919,"Much appreciated! Great word-of-mouth is why Model is the best-selling electric car, despite no advertising or paid endorsements."
6920,"The multi-coat colors (pearl white &amp; red) are hardest, red especially, as it has red tint in the clear coat layer itself for depth &amp; complexity"
6921,"Sorry, weve put pretty extreme rules in place for paint &amp; quality in general. If need be, were repainting/replacing entire sections of car or building whole new cars. Got to be done."
6922,Can Steve Bannon please insult me some more? Best PR Ive had in a while.
6923,I was told that his parents preferred that his name not be mentioned
6924,V cool
6925,So you actually did nothing &amp; yet imply you are a truth-seeker. The Twitter name you chose is .
6926,"Answer the question . You brought it up, not me. Did you investigate or not? If so, what did you actually do?"
6927,"At this point, I want ETH even if it is a scam"
6928,Did you investigate at all? Im guessing answer is no. Why?
6929,"Its coming, I swear"
6930,You dont think its strange he hasnt sued me? He was offered free legal services. And you call yourself

6937,This is utterly false. Fossil fuel merchants of doubt have been pushing that bs for years. Tesla Gigafactory will be % renewable powered (by Tesla Solar) by end of next year.
6938,"Most people dont realize that the cost of operating an electric vehicle is much lower than a gas car. Electricity is way cheaper than gas plus no oil changes, tune-ups,smog checks &amp; other service costs."
6939,"Most major customers have tried it &amp; love it. Now we need to finish production design &amp; build it, while avoiding dumb mistakes made with Model production system. Wish it wasnt so hard to be less stupid over time"
6940,Maybe
6941,"This was key showstopper for me personally. Couldnt make it happen, even through expert fiduciary SPV, without creating exotic trust structure that would prob not be accepted by regulators. Current rules have good intentions, but make wealth creation harder for small investors."
6942,"The extension cord was miles long, but still"
6943,"Whats cool is that it was driven across the country alone (no escort or any accompanying vehicles), using the existing Tesla Supercharger network and an extension cord"
6944,"In talking to our public investors, most were supportive of optimizing for long-term value creation over quarterly earnings. This was also a factor in remaining public."
6945,Its almost done
6946,"Yes , looks brutal otherwise"
6947,This is actually real
6948,"This time, the vacuum tunnel will be a bit longer &amp; SpaceX will provide some advance funding for student teams with most promising designs. Bonus award for all race pods that exceed half the speed of sound!"

6950,I was just there. Cardboard being prepped for recycling along southern fence line caught fire. Super appreciate fast response by Fremont fire dept! No injuries or damage to factory.
6951,"Goal is to service your car wherever you are, quietly &amp; quickly. No need to bring it to a Tesla service center."
6952,Ok
6953,"Love born in the brain is more spirited, doubtless, than true love, but it has only flashes of enthusiasm; it knows itself too well, it criticizes itself incessantly; so far from banishing thought, it is itself reared only upon a structure of thought. The Red and The Black"

7005,Investor support is confirmed. Only reason why this is not certain is that its contingent on a shareholder vote.
7006,Def no forced sales. Hope all shareholders remain. Will be way smoother &amp; less disruptive as a private company. Ends negative propaganda from shorts.
7007,"Yes, but liquidity events would be limited to every months or so (like SpaceX)"
7008,No change
7009,Shareholders could either to sell at or hold shares &amp; go private
7010,Absolutely. Am super appreciative of Tesla shareholders. Will ensure their prosperity in any scenario.
7011,My hope is *all* current investors remain with Tesla even if were private. Would create special purpose fund enabling anyone to stay with Tesla. Already do this with Fidelitys SpaceX investment.
7012,Yes
7013,I dont have a controlling vote now &amp; wouldnt expect any shareholder to have one if we go private. I wont be selling in either scenario.

7094,Great!
7095,Weve gone from ~1000 S/X deliveries per week in US last year to ~6000 S/3/X. Its like hitting a square wave.
7096,"Were trying to get rid of contracts completely. Should just be tap here &amp; you get your car. Then, if you dont like it for any reason, just return it like any other product."
7097,Yeah. Never seen it so high ever.
7098,"Wow, thats really awesome. Thank you!"
7099,Haha
7100,"Looks good, but so many details need to be right. Journey back from hypersonic becomes extremely difficult as velocity increases. Altitude is easy, velocity is hard."
7101,Only costs that actually apply to Q3 &amp; beyond will be counted. It would not be correct to apply historical cost savings to current quarter.
7102,Wall Street
7103,Congratulations to all teams in the student competition! To make high-speed pods that can operate in vacuum is very difficult. Was great to meet everyone!
7104,"Exactly. Overheat protection is always on, but you can also tap maintain &amp; your car will hold a cool or warm temp for a few hours while parked."
7105,"Yes, Tesla Model S, X &amp; all automatically keep cabin temperature within safe limits even when parked"

7110,It is much better
7111,Sorry
7112,I love that scene
7113,I made that up tbh. They did not have phones during the French Revolution. They used Friendster.
7114,Dont make me bite my thumb at you
7115,For sure
7116,"Btw, is calling &amp; wants its method of execution back. Seriously, what museum do you plan to raid?"
7117,"Yeah, great point. Underground power lines would clear up the skyline, be safer to service, have better uptime &amp; save lives of many birds."
7118,No kidding
7119,"Yes, that will probably be its first use"
7120,"Phew . Yeah, we had a drain block months ago &amp; people are working hard to make Tesla successful. Am honored to work with them. Are you trolling for fun or is it part of a job? What motivates you?"
7121,I apologized. Do you stand by your guillotine statement or not?
7122,"Figuratively, literally or both?"
7123,That has always been our goal
7124,"This chart only shows globally competed commercial launches, not US government missions. Other US refers to Boeing &amp; Lockheed. Their skill at obtaining govt contracts &amp; subsidies vastly exceeds ours."
7125,"Dunno where this bs is coming from. Who knows about the future, but last week we had over S/X and Model *new* net orders."
7126,Definitely. We gave up some grip &amp; width in exchange for range. Would recommend stickier tires &amp; wider on rear for best performance. You might get sec -60 mph or better with optimized rims &amp; tires.
7127,"Wow, someone has really thought about this!"

7129,"Nonetheless, his actions against me do not justify my actions against him, and for that I apologize to Mr. Unsworth and to the companies I represent as leader. The fault is mine and mine alone."
7130,"As this well-written article suggests, my words were spoken in anger after Mr. Unsworth said several untruths &amp; suggested I engage in a sexual act with the mini-sub, which had been built as an act of kindness &amp; according to specifications from the dive team leader."
7131,Good point
7132,I have never donated to a SuperPAC

7135,Thank you for fighting climate change. This affects every living creature on Earth.
7136,"That said, I do not actually see the checks (changed that policy today). A nominal annual amount goes out automatically to both parties to maintain dialogue. I have given vastly more to humanitarian causes."
7137,So that they are willing to listen when I call to object about issues that negatively affect humanity
7138,"Thanks Jack. To be clear, I am not a conservative. Am registered independent &amp; politically moderate. Doesnt mean Im moderate about all issues. Humanitarian issues are extremely important to me &amp; I dont understand why they are not important to everyone."

7169,Sure
7170,"Look, at least its not the Magellanic Clouds. Theyre basically next door."
7171,"Just between us, I have a teleportation stargate to the Andromeda galaxy. Its amazing."
7172,So true
7173,The pumps I saw were running v high flow rate all the way from cave . They stopped shortly after boys were rescued &amp; water level rose to roof level all way back to cave . That was great work.
7174,Sounds good
7175,Glad to hear that. Engineering team also getting feedback from the British dive team on how to improve the design for future applications.
7176,It will happen for sure. Damn.
7177,Should drive temp to target. Why fan speed on app?

7184,"For now, reply to my tweet with ppm &amp; ppb test results &amp; will send someone to install a water filter. Creating email flint.com, but Im in China so that wont be working until tomorrow."
7185,Please consider this a commitment that I will fund fixing the water in any house in Flint that has water contamination above FDA levels. No kidding.
7186,Great move
7187,Why sir
7188,Stockholm: its not just a syndrome
7189,Good point
7190,"Definitely. Cant wait to try that. Been a little distracted past few months on mostly Tesla matters, but back at it soon."
7191,"Yes, and springy, like a highly damped trampoline"
7192,Well it looked smaller on paper
7193,"Catching rocket fairings falling from space has proven tricky, so we made the net really big"
7194,"Yes. Caves are now filled with water again. Difficulty of passage is massively dependent on water level. Little kids can walk/swim in when low, but it can be deadly to pro divers when high. Pump &amp; generator engineering team deserves some credit for the rescue."
7195,It sometimes feels like reality is a moral filter. I suppose that is what religion tells us. Wonder what I should do differently.
7196,Makes a lot of sense
7197,This reaction has shaken my opinion of many people. We were asked to create a backup option &amp; worked hard to do so. Checked with dive team many times to confirm it was worthwhile. Now its there for anyone who needs it in future. Somethings messed up if this is not a good thing.
7198,I think the person who attacked me on Twitter will survive somehow
7199,Thanks for correcting me. I meant to say over half a million people.
7200,Please lmk contamination levels of any kind when you test the water
7201,Please lmk results of your water tests
7202,"When youre there next week, are you planning to test water sources for lead?"
7203,Should be very soon. Weve already made around Model Performance cars for test drives in stores.
7204,Exactly
7205,"No, it means I created jobs for people directly and, through parts suppliers &amp; supporting professions, ~250,000 people indirectly, thus supporting half a million families. What have you done?"
7206,Already have
7207,"Ironically, the billionaire label, when used by media, is almost always meant to devalue &amp; denigrate the subject. I wasnt called that until my companies got to a certain size, but reality is that I still do the same science &amp; engineering as before. Just the scale has changed."
7208,"Good for rescuing vulnerable patients in dangerous environments, particularly if water, toxic gas or dangerous bacteria/viruses present, as patient would remain dry &amp; at std air pressure entire time."
7209,"Yes, it was specifically designed to pass that point"
7210,"Moreover, based on extensive cave video review &amp; discussion with several divers who know journey, SpaceX engineering is absolutely certain that mini-sub can do entire journey &amp; demonstrate at any time."
7211,"The former Thai provincial governor (described inaccurately as rescue chief) is not the subject matter expert. That would be Dick Stanton, who co-led the dive rescue team. This is our direct correspondence:"
7212,Great news that they made it out safely. Congratulations to an outstanding rescue team!
7213,Ok
7214,Just returned from Cave . Mini-sub is ready if needed. It is made of rocket parts &amp; named Wild Boar after kids soccer team. Leaving here in case it may be useful in the future. Thailand is so beautiful.
7215,That would be cool. I wonder what its like under all that ice.
7216,A second one that is cm shorter is almost complete
7217,Yes. Those videos are from this morning.
7218,"According to divers who have made the passage, yes. However, we also made an exact replica that is inflatable, so that the entire path can be tested without risk of blockage."
7219,Simulating maneuvering through a narrow passage
7220,"Thanks, but weve not done anything useful yet. It is all other people."
7221,"According to divers who have made the journey, this is capable of maneuvering through all passages"
7222,Tube diameter is cm
7223,"Mini-sub arriving in about hours. Hopefully useful. If not, perhaps it will be in a future situation."
7224,Thanks for letting us use your pool
7225,It is an honor to work with them
7226,"With some mods, this could also work as an escape pod in space"
7227,I want to know who is running the Etherium scambots! Mad skillz
7228,It is both alarming &amp; explanatory that you run a psych ward
7229,"Diver weight belts wrapped around outside. Mini-sub only weighs ~40kg dry, so easy to carry on long dry sections of cave, then add weight belts for wet sections."
7230,"Yeah, that sounds cool. Music makes things better. Calms the mind. Adding padded wall pockets for a hand radio &amp; phone/music player."
7231,"Aluminum shell has high thermal conductivity, so will be close to ambient. If ambient is cold, a thin layer of neoprene insulation around interior will keep occupant warm."
7232,Buoyancy adjusted by strapping diver weight belts around body of capsule. Theyre prevented from sliding off by the diver handhold attachments.
7233,"Testing for more hours in LA, then its on a plane to Thailand"
7234,"Design based on dive team feedback (primarily Stanton): air / oxygen ports front &amp; rear, front ports protected by nosecone. Dual O-ring seal on acrylic rear plate with clear view of occupant head. Leak/buckling proof to X cave water pressure."
7235,I am an engineer
7236,Tight control code is always C
7237,Python is done right. Great name story too.
7238,"If I am a narcissist (which might be true), at least I am a useful one"

7240,Pretty close. There is a nosecone on the front to protect against rocks impacting fwd air hoses with a hole on the side for hoses to exit.
7241,Turbo
7242,C
7243,"Given Chiang Rai airport hours, soonest we couldve departed US was an hour ago, but cave now closed for diver rescue. Will continue testing in LA in case needed later or for somewhere else in future."
7244,"Will do. Even if not useful here, perhaps it will be in a future situation."
7245,Extremely talented dive team. Makes sense given monsoon. Godspeed.
7246,Yes
7247,Yes
7248,Fitted for a kid or small adult to minimize open air. Segmented compartments to place rocks or dive weights &amp; adjust bouyancy.
7249,Yes
7250,"handles/hitch points on front &amp; on rear. air tank connections on front &amp; on rear, allowing to tanks simultaneously connected, all recessed for impact protection w secondary cap seal if leak develops."
7251,Im in LA working with the SpaceX team building the kid mini-sub
7252,"Construction complete in about hours, then hour flight to Thailand"
7253,"Continue to be amazed by the bravery, resilience &amp; tenacity of kids &amp; diving team in Thailand. Human character at its best."
7254,"Got more great feedback from Thailand. Primary path is basically a tiny, kid-size submarine using the liquid oxygen transfer tube of Falcon rocket as hull. Light enough to be carried by divers, small enough to get through narrow gaps. Extremely robust."
7255,Ground winds would
7256,Yes. All-weather. ~300km/h high altitude winds. ~60km/h ground winds. Its a beast.
7257,Cant be too buoyant
7258,"Some good feedback from cave experts in Thailand. Iterating with them on an escape pod design that might be safe enough to try. Also building an inflatable tube with airlocks. Less likely to work, given tricky contours, but great if it does."
7259,Good idea
7260,"Prob wise to add an air tank (butt end fwd to take impacts) in nose of pod &amp; vent valve in rear. Set air tank to slow bleed rate, then no need for SCUBA mouthpiece or regulator. Training unnecessary &amp; less susceptible to panic attack."
7261,Youre welcome. Happy birthday!
7262,"Yeah, thats what Im talking about in that tweet double-layer Kevlar pressure pod with Teflon coating. Other approach is a long inflatable air sock. Both worth trying."
7263,Exactly. You can put socks on your feet the same way. There would be no relative motion between the tube &amp; rock wall.
7264,Its open so that others who are closer to the problem can consider this as one possible solution
7265,"Should be possible to increase the air inflow rate above the leak rate, unless there is a very big hole. If oxygen % is dropping, suggests that leak holes are not large."
7266,I would def recommend this
7267,Building double-layer Kevlar pressure pods with Teflon coating to slip by rocks &amp; front/rear rope tow hitch &amp; lead pockets for neutral buoyancy. ~60 cm oval. Testing this aft in a pool with a subject who has never done SCUBA. Do the divers think something like this might work?
7268,Interesting
7269,"Great, thanks"
7270,Inflatable tubes &amp; pods being made out of Kevlar for better abrasion resistance. A SpaceX engineer happens to be in Thailand &amp; is headed there now. Could one of the divers DM me? Need approx contour of most difficult sections for tube fab.
7271,"So long as air pressure in tube higher than water pressure, air will blow out &amp; water wont come in"
7272,"Does you know output voltage &amp; amperage of those generator trucks? phase? What frequency? Will need high voltage transformer to carry power over distance or very thick cable. Beyond that, only batteries will work. Will prep Powerwalls in case needed."
7273,SpaceX &amp; Boring Co engineers headed to Thailand tomorrow to see if we can be helpful to govt. There are probably many complexities that are hard to appreciate without being there in person.
7274,"Looks like st bit of water is close enough to entrance to be pumped out. nd &amp; rd would need battery packs, air pumps &amp; tubes. If depth of nd is accurate, would need ~0.5 bar tube pressure. Prob need to enter tube, zip up &amp; then transit."
7275,"So long as air feed rate exceeds leak rate, tube remains inflated. This is how bouncy castles or inflatable mazes work. Needs very little power as the work (physics def of work) done is low. Pumping out water faster than it enters the cave system is prob X to X more power."
7276,Have a small velcro slit entrance &amp; exit in circumferential direction (half stress of longitudinal direction)
7277,"Walking speed is around km/h, but if youre in an air tube, time doesnt matter much. If tube diameter was m, a fast walk of km would take mins or so. Just need to duck for the narrow sections."
7278,Maybe worth trying: insert a m diameter nylon tube (or shorter set of tubes for most difficult sections) through cave network &amp; inflate with air like a bouncy castle. Should create an air tunnel underwater against cave roof &amp; auto-conform to odd shapes like the cm hole.
7279,Exactly. A journalist who publicly expresses love for &amp; parties in Vegas with a prominent shortseller of any given company should disclose this when writing articles.
7280,"I know you &amp; believe you, but it means Lopez misled readers in her article, because that is exactly what she said"
7281,I didnt ask anyone and the people who sent the snapshots dont work for me. They just dont like hypocrites.
7282,They were sent to me by multiple people on the Internet. I dont use Facebook.
7283,Lopez wrote that Melissa Lee of CNBC was dancing her face off with Chanos in Vegas. Is this true?
7284,Why did publish a love letter puff piece about Chanoss cuff links? Who took the pic? Obv not objective
7285,. posted on social media that she was partying in Vegas with Chanos &amp; Tepper with caption Love both these dudes. Doesnt sound very objective
7286,"Norwegians are right to be upset with Tesla. We are having trouble expanding our service facilities in Oslo especially. Can solve quickly with Tesla mobile service vans, but awaiting govt permission to do so."
7287,Are you % certain that stands by &amp; supports everything shes done? Why wont Lopez go on record saying that she never offered Tripp anything for inside info or asked him to break his confidentiality agreement by taking detailed video of Tesla IP?
7288,Sounds fishy. How did that go down?
7289,True
7290,"So publicly stated she stans for Chanos, Teslas most prominent short-seller. In her words, he is one of the greatest. Her articles print Chanoss view verbatim. This is not journalism."
7291,". You stated publicly that you see eye to eye with Chanos, the most prominent short-seller of Tesla. Have you ever provided him with material non-public information about Tesla?"
7292,What a coincidence
7293,Am not attacking all media or even all of . Just asked if you inform public about an analysts prediction track record about a subject when putting them on your show.
7294,"Indeed, very simple question. To be specific: , did you compensate or promise to compensate Martin Tripp for inside information about Tesla? Did he, under that inducement, provide you with exaggerated negative info, which you printed, but turned out to be untrue?"
7295,"Exactly. , I just asked a simple question. Please answer."
7296,"Strange. , is it true that you are putting on analysts with such low ratings &amp; extremely bad prediction records? Are your viewers informed about an analysts track record before hearing their opinion."
7297,"Note, no one is in the car or controlling remotely. Car is driving entirely by itself."
7298,"Sounds very sketchy if true. , is it possible youre serving as an inside trading source for one of Teslas biggest short-sellers? An ex-Tesla employee just went on record formally claiming you bribed him &amp; he sent you valuable Tesla IP in exchange. Is this true?"
7299,"has published several false articles about Tesla, including a doozy where she claimed Tesla scrapped more batteries than our total S,X &amp;3 production number, which is physically impossible."
7300,"Wow, so of wrote article that misled public about Model production &amp; followed that up with mean tweet to me on my bday. Nice work &amp; ."
7301,"., why did you mislead the people public about this number?"
7302,". is relentlessly negative about Tesla. They just wrote a bogus article saying S production last week was low by cars. S/X annual prod is set at ~100k, ie /week. Tesla built S/X cars at our standard ~50/50 split last week, which is right on target."
7303,Happy to support
7304,"Boring Co has advanced ground penetrating radar &amp; is pretty good at digging holes. Dont know if pump rate is limited by electric power or pumps are too smal. If so, could dropship fully charged Powerpacks and pumps."

7382,"of the children, remained where they were placed, had moved, had run away and five were deported. That left migrant children. Just because their parents or guardians did not return HHSs phone calls after days does not mean the children are missing"
7383,"All children were resettled by HHS. After days, the department called the parents or guardians to check up on things. But these calls were not required by law, and in cases, the parents or guardians did not respond"
7384,This Washington Post article seems good
7385,"As individuals, we will all die in blink of an eye on a galactic timescale. What can live on for long time is civilization. Those who first go to other planets will face far more risk of death &amp; hardship than those who stay. Over time, space travel will be safe &amp; open to all."
7386,"This doesnt take into account shifting trillions of tons of carbon from subsurface to atmosphere, which could accelerate overheating time by a factor of a million (or so). This is why Tesla."
7387,"A billion at most, so % max. Still basically in the nick of time from an age-of-Earth standpoint."
7388,"Humanity is not perfect, but its all weve got"
7389,"Could be very close call. Earth is ~4.5B years old &amp; sun will expand to heat Earth beyond livable temp in ~0.5B years, so if advent of civilization took % longer, it wouldnt have happened at all."
7390,"Lets find out. It would be amazing to encounter an alien civilization, provided it is not their invasion fleet!"
7391,Good news coming soon
7392,Yes
7393,"Yes, we are essentially a steward of life &amp; duty-bound imo to ensure its continuance"
7394,Life is good
7395,"It is unknown whether we are the only civilization currently alive in the observable universe, but any chance that we are is added impetus for extending life beyond Earth"
7396,This is why we must preserve the light of consciousness by becoming a spacefaring civilization &amp; extending life to other planets
7397,So strange
7398,"Critical autonomous safety features like emergency braking are standard, but convenience features like active cruise control are not"
7399,"Its a tough call. Reality is that it will be pretty easy to bully a self-driving car, as it will always yield. Will prob have a manual override that requires continuous press for hardcore lane changes."
7400,"We considered going beyond Mad Max to LA Freeway level, but thats too loco"

7412,Working in the factory
7413,Expanding the tour soon. So many cool things to see. Tesla car factory has rd largest footprint of any building on Earth. Maybe st if you include all our sweet tents
7414,Looks so sus when we paint cars red
7415,Which rolls out today
7416,Will be there in next release
7417,So big you cant believe it
7418,srsly
7419,Vicious torque

7421,Good catch!
7422,Exactly
7423,What is my purpose? Sentient seats.

7427,"That would be tricky to sequence, but maybe"
7428,Was thinking of offering an extended Tesla factory tour option where you could help build part of a car &amp; understand how they come together. I know it would have been super fun for me when I was a kid (or now).
7429,Its called Top Secret
7430,Yes
7431,"When I was a kid, I built model airplanes, trainsets, rockets (mixed my own powder), explosives (kinda surprised I still have all fingers), a radio, lots of software. Built a primitive MRI machine in college."
7432,"Yeah, but Im not sure what the big deal is. I like building things. If that ends up being useful work too, even better."
7433,We will add a config to lower the alert
7434,Apply light force to the steering wheel. Alert is being changed to this text.
7435,Try saying bug report. Might work better. Ironic if the bug report about bug reports isnt working
7436,"Thanks for the feedback, will investigate"
7437,Sure
7438,Congratulations!
7439,Its actually pretty fun building electric cars. Product is useful to other people &amp; good for environment. I think thats fundamental goodness.

7446,Thanks for coming by our car factory with . Tesla team was super fired up to see you! Congrats on your victory!!
7447,"Crazy, that was over years ago. Thanks for believing in us!"
7448,"There is more, but the actions of a few bad apples will not stop Tesla from reaching its goals. With people, the worst in will have issues. Thats still ~40 people."
7449,Today. Its kinda there in US with welfare but rules are messed up and amount is too low.
7450,Also think there should be a universal basic income that doesnt change even if you get a job. Productivity should be rewarded.
7451,Because honey is a vegetable
7452,Considerably less so than our competitors (longer discussion)
7453,"Yes, consumption tax is way better. Also, higher estate tax better than income/cap gains tax. Probability of progeny being equally excellent at capital allocation is not high."
7454,Exactly
7455,"Hes obv wrong. Forcing function for any % mkt share monopolist to improve is weak &amp; a national govt is that by fiat. One may find lowish correlation for negativity, but that does not mean low causation."
7456,Great name. A little on the nose.
7457,"Thats really decision about how good you think govt is at allocating capital. Buffett, for example, is vastly better than any govt at allocating capital. Consumption vs capital allocation extremely misunderstood. Biggest missing piece in public understanding of what money is."
7458,"Yeah, all-inclusive tax rate of % seems about right. Below % is unrealistic for critical govt functions unless national defense is de facto outsourced &amp; above % too negatively affects economic output."
7459,Cool video
7460,Thank you for helping those in need

7482,Youre probably right. Maybe after Tesla drama calms down.
7483,Im at the factory a lot. Pretty good workout just walking around. Its big.
7484,They look beautiful
7485,Will maybe do a media tour next week. Team deserves recognition. This was miraculous.
7486,Its actually way better than the factory building. More comfortable &amp; a great view of the mountains.
7487,Not sure we actually need a building. This tent is pretty sweet. Tesla Grohmann line is in place at Giga &amp; spooling up now. They super kicked ass too. Heiliger Strohsack!
7488,They also poured the concrete &amp; built the whole assembly line using scrap we had in warehouses. And its way better than the other GA line that cost hundreds of millions!
7489,No
7490,"Needed another general assembly line to reach k/week Model production. A new building was impossible, so we built a giant tent in weeks. Tesla team kfa!! Gah, love them so much"
7491,"Youre welcome, bad fiction writer"
7492,"Dude, we are California, which is extremely pro union. People can form a union tomorrow &amp; nothing Tesla could do to stop it. UAW cant even get enough sigs to request a vote, cause they have nothing to offer."
7493,Your union brothers
7494,You wont find pro-union either. The books are all about freedom. No one is forced to join any organization.
7495,"Thanks, good advice"
7496,They have about three weeks before their short position explodes
7497,Good points. Already mostly working in the developer software Im driving.
7498,Cant wait for the new season to start!
7499,"Weve always provided healthcare, hourly wages above union &amp; Tesla stock. Also, free drinks &amp; snacks. Try to make it fun too. Top ten hourly workers cumulatively received Tesla stock now worth $1M to $2M. Nobody wants UAW, so UAW keeps trashing Tesla &amp; me via rd parties."
7500,Glad you teach physics. That and critical thinking (ie how not to be tricked) are foundational for all kids to learn.
7501,"Yeah, I think we pretty much agree. Btw, great show."
7502,"I think essential services, incl health care, should be taken care of by govt/taxpayers (socialist) &amp; other parts of economy should be served by companies competing to serve the people (capitalist). Aka, the view held by most of America."
7503,They started it &amp; attacked me personally
7504,Search UAW and corruption. Very long reading list. Great organization.
7505,Profit just means you earned more money than you spent &amp; certainly does spark innovation. Jesus. This is obv a good thing &amp; extremely hard. It has taken Tesla years &amp; were almost there. Every other US car company besides Ford &amp; Tesla has gone bankrupt.
7506,They dont seem to think much or care about the future beyond a narrow horizon
7507,Engels wrote nd &amp; rd volumes based on Marxs notes. Less reliable.
7508,"Wanted to help transition the world to sustainable, clean energy and extend life as we know it beyond Earth. Those problems require a lot of hardware."
7509,"Wow, you know nothing &amp; are worthy of contempt. The world is under massive attack due to climate change &amp; you couldnt care less."
7510,"Read it. Like the green, translucent Martian opal?"
7511,Iron pyrite
7512,Congratulations to LA Times and Patrick Soon-Shiong!
7513,"Youre just a troll/bot, but I will reply anyway. I arrived in Montreal at by myself with $2k. No support, no contacts, nothing. Father said Id fail &amp; be back in months."
7514,"I dont want to see anyone lose their money. Or I will at least provide fair warning before it happens, as I have done in the past."
7515,You think all companies are bad and all unions good? Thats a very bigoted position.
7516,Well said
7517,Then youll be fine
7518,Exactly. Our NDA is actually shorter &amp; simpler than most.
7519,"...which clearly doesnt work. UAW and Wall Street shorts know every detail of whats happening at Tesla. Storm clouds are gathering, so theyre getting desperate."
7520,"Then look a little closer, doctorow. Read the whole thread."
7521,More propaganda. The NDA only prevents disclosure of Tesla proprietary IP or material non-public information (insider trading).
7522,How big is your short position? Just curious.
7523,Union flyers are handed out all the time in the factory. I know because people in the factory laugh at the ridiculous propaganda &amp; hand them to me. This one guys claim about being stopped once in a parking lot is false and irrelevant.
7524,"I endorse freedom to form a union too, as well as freedom not to do so if they feel Tesla is a good company. UAW has major conflicts of interest &amp; failed our car plant already when they abandoned us in . Tesla can only hire % of applicants, so must be doing something right."
7525,"UAW doesnt have % of signatures (about people) needed for a vote. They cant even muster enough people for a free bbq. Instead, theyre getting paid trolls &amp; far left shills to trash Tesla &amp; me in press &amp; social media. Such creeps."
7526,"Im not against all unions, but UAW has a track record of destroying productivity so a company cant compete on world market. Our current factory went bankrupt under UAW before we took it over. Dont want Tesla to die too."
7527,"I am too, of sorts. Govt (ie other taxpayers) should take care of critical needs of people, incl defense, judiciary, health care, etc. Rest should be companies competing to provide best product or service to the people."
7528,"Was originally called Puff the Magic Dragon, as people said I was high if though it could work, so I named it after their insult."
7529,"Iain certainly wasnt pro-union in the Culture books. At all. And wouldnt be in the case of Tesla. Banks was about freedom through &amp; through. Maybe for a single buyer (monopsony) vs single seller (monopoly), I would be too, but thats a special case."
7530,"SX &amp; soon SX . Kind of a modern version of Inconel superalloys. High strength at temperature, extreme oxidation resistance. Needed for ~800 atmosphere, hot, oxygen-rich turbopump on Raptor rocket engine."

7532,Love you too
7533,Fair point
7534,"Auto-semiotic asphyxiation (sorry, couldnt resist)"
7535,And I dont trust that Engels guy. He could have made up most of nd &amp; rd volumes. Nobody actually knows.

7545,"All of them, especially Surface Detail"
7546,"If you must know, I am a utopian anarchist of the kind best described by Iain Banks"
7547,I disagree with that goal &amp; gave away Tesla patents to help other companies
7548,"If Im not a communist, why do I make red cars"
7549,"Very appealing if youre a sophomore in college. Its a counterpoint to communism and useful as such, but should be tempered with kindness."
7550,That is why it is critical to support competition. Excess profits draw in competitors who then drive down prices.
7551,lol
7552,"Read Das Kapital when I was , incl cross-checking English translation of original German. Adam Smith FTW obv. Ironically, future automation will naturally lead to greater equality of consumption. Monopolies are true enemy of people. Competing to serve is good."
7553,Might actually be his!
7554,Amazing work by Tesla team. Built entire new general assembly line in weeks w minimal resources. Love u guys so much! Pic of st Model dual motor performance coming off the line
7555,Youre a docile puppet of the UAW. Be honest about what you are.
7556,Yes
7557,Sigh
7558,"By the way, I am actually a socialist. Just not the kind that shifts resources from most productive to least productive, pretending to do good, while actually causing harm. True socialism seeks greatest good for all."
7559,No sense of humor is certainly proving itself true. Good grief! How many socialists does it take to screw in a lightbulb? Answer: Thats not funny!!

7561,Lake Show
7562,"Heading back into the factory, so thats enough for now. Dont take my Tweet too seriously. For one thing, its called a Tweet."
7563,No
7564,My father has no money. Only reason he even has a house is because my brother &amp; I bought it for him on condition that he not cause harm to others. That obviously failed.
7565,"There is considerable confusion between wealth as consumption &amp; wealth as labor allocation. By latter measure, anyone in govt whose budget exceeds $1B is a billionaire. Government is the largest corporation."
7566,Socialism vs capitalism is not even the right question. What really matters is avoiding monopolies that restrict peoples freedom.
7567,Universal income will be necessary over time if AI takes over most human jobs
7568,Marx was a capitalist. He even wrote a book about it.
7569,A socialist
7570,"Those who proclaim themselves socialists are usually depressing, have no sense of humor &amp; attended an expensive college. Fate loves irony."
7571,What is yours?
7572,What is your utopia?
7573,The future is a set of branching probability streams. Some actions by humanity have an extremely leveraged effect on shape &amp; size of those streams.
7574,Strongly disagree. I love humanity.

7576,I always wanted to do a terms &amp; conditions cover of Green Eggs &amp; Ham
7577,Foundation Series &amp; Zeroth Law are fundamental to creation of SpaceX
7578,I love Banks. Best books in recent years imo are Iain Banks &amp; George Martin.
7579,"Given how bad I am at poetry, probably Vogon"
7580,Should prob articulate philosophy underlying my actions. Its pretty simple &amp; mostly influenced by Douglas Adams &amp; Isaac Asimov.
7581,My donations are anonymous
7582,Already sold &gt;$100M TSLA for charity. Will do about that every few years. Major disbursements in about years when Tesla is steady state.
7583,"My pay is in options, which only matter if stock goes up &amp; I sell. Will use that to make life multiplanetary, help education &amp; environment on Earth w my foundation. Just dont want us to be sad about the future."
7584,Dankonia
7585,We use less than % cobalt in our batteries &amp; will use none in next gen
7586,"Yes, interface will change with Version software"
7587,"Will be adjusting screen alert to clarify that we mean slight up or downward force on the wheel, not really hold the wheel"
7588,"Some very, very tough calls. Had to let go of good people, but I think they will find new jobs quickly."
7589,"Difficult, but necessary Tesla reorg underway. My email to the company has already leaked to media. Here it is unfiltered:"
7590,That is actual footage
7591,Back in the Precambrian era when the main form of life was a sponge
7592,Thanks! Have heard universally great things about your podcasts.
7593,"Of course, but its the kind of hustle that you like even with full knowledge. People can obv read the Internet &amp; anyone who wants a refund will get one. I predict basically zero. The honest-to-goodness fun value is amazing &amp; were never going to make them again."
7594,"Trade is just that Roadster becomes a seater instead of a +2. COPV in place of the kid seats, which is prob wise for many reasons"
7595,"Exactly. Total energy stored even in ultra compressed air is low vs battery, but power output is insane. The composite overwrapped pressure vessel (COPV) is most advanced ever made. Its what SpaceX is qualifying for NASA crewed missions. Extremely robust literally bulletproof."
7596,Not recommended for urban environments
7597,Yes
7598,"The actual amount of time I spend on Twitter is tiny. My tweets are literally what Im thinking at the moment, not carefully crafted corporate bs, which is really just banal propaganda."
7599,It is amazingly hard to find a simple solution. A complicated one is relatively easy.
7600,Love this design. Simpler the better.
7601,Add an R for Roadster
7602,"Sigh. This is crux of matter: cant make system too annoying or people wont use it, negatively affecting safety, but also cant allow people to get too complacent or safety again suffers. Latest update should have a positive effect on latter issue especially."
7603,A lot of people whose judgment I respect have suggested this. Sounds like a good idea. Will do so after Model production reaches k/week steady.
7604,"Yes. Hopefully, Im not tempting fate too much with that date. It was meant as a joke, but is about the right actual timing."
7605,Will do
7606,"Correct, pure electric. Wish orbital rockets could be so too, but theres no escaping Newtons Third Law. SpaceX is already developing high efficiency CO2 capture with H2O to form liquid CH4 (methane) &amp; O2. Critical for propellant production at Mars Base Alpha."
7607,"You have my word, Marques. Next gen Roadster will be absolutely out of this world. For those who love to drive, there is no finer car in history and we dont think there will be another."
7608,"Note, gas contained would be ultra high pressure air in a SpaceX rocket COPV bottle. The air exiting the thrusters would immediately be replenished whenever vehicle pack power draw allowed operation of the air pump, which is most of the time."
7609,"Intent of new Tesla Roadster is to beat gas sports cars on every performance metric by far, no exceptions, thus transferring the halo crown effect gas cars have as the top speed leaders over to pure electric."
7610,"That issue is better in latest Autopilot software rolling out now &amp; fully fixed in August update as part of our long-awaited Tesla Version . To date, Autopilot resources have rightly focused entirely on safety. With V9, we will begin to enable full self-driving features."
7611,"This is why Im not impressed when reporters who were literally in junior high while I was in newsrooms all round the world say that if I only knew how newsrooms really worked, then Id know everythings fine &amp; no need for a media credibility rating system like Pravduh"
7612,"Zip2 also built a newspaper publishing platform that brought hundreds of regional &amp; city papers online for the first time, and made major functionality advancements to the NY Times, Boston Globe &amp; Knight-Ridder websites. NYT, KR &amp; Hearst were all major investors in Zip2."
7613,years of intense programming on extremely weak CPUs with nothing for memory &amp; a straw for bandwidth tends to burn itself onto your like a branding iron. Can still remember trying to squeeze fractions of a millisecond out of the /?}%$&amp; fetch_joystick_state function.
7614,"In early s, I wrote a multitasker for PCs that spoofed the CPU &amp; CD-ROM to act in parallel, so could read video continuously while player sprite moved smoothly. Required C++, assembly &amp; direct flipping of CPU registers. That companys name was Rocket Science. Fate loves irony."
7615,"Thats quite a blast from the past! After my Zip2 experience w patents, I felt that patents (particularly software) inhibited innovation, instead of fostering it. I aspired to file zero patents after that. In , we open-sourced all Tesla patents"
7616,"At Zip2, I wrote entire V1 of software for drawing vector maps &amp; calculating point to point directions anywhere in US (first ever company to do so), as well as white pages &amp; business listings w reviews (an early Yelp). Also wrote V1 of classifieds, autotrading &amp; real estate apps."
7617,"More background: I arrived in North America at w $2000, a backpack &amp; a suitcase full of books. Paid my own way thru college. Dropped out of Stanford Eng/Phys grad school w $110k in college debt. Created Internet startup w bro &amp; Greg Khouri (love bro &amp; loved Greg, may he RIP)"
7618,"We dont think our product will be the cause of any wildfires, but The Boring Company is donating $10k."
7619,"Using the config you describe, plus an electric pump to replenish air in COPV, when car power draw drops below max pack power output, makes sense. But we are going to go a lot further."
7620,"years ago, when my st company got bought, I had to decide between buying a house in Palo Alto or a McLaren F1 (best car ever imo). Was no contest. I bought F1 &amp; a small condo that was much cheaper than the car. New Tesla Roadster will exceed all gas sports cars in every way"
7621,"SpaceX option package for new Tesla Roadster will include ~10 small rocket thrusters arranged seamlessly around car. These rocket engines dramatically improve acceleration, top speed, braking &amp; cornering. Maybe they will even allow a Tesla to fly"
7622,"Terms &amp; conditions for Not-a-Flamethrower Please use as directed to avoid unintentionally burning things down. For simple &amp; concise instructions, we drew upon wisdom in great Dr Seuss book Green Eggs and Ham."
7623,"Almost forgot! Due to recent regulatory/customs rules enacted to inhibit transport of anything called a Flamethrower, we have renamed our product: Not a Flamethrower."
7624,Yes
7625,Each flamethrower comes with a state-of-the-art The Boring Company brand fire extinguisher. Will offer a TBC ice blaster before the dry season starts in winter.
7626,"Flamethrower obv best way to light your fireplace/BBQ. No more need to use a dainty match to ignite! If no wood, just drop your flamethrower in fire place! It will generate way more warmth than a quaint pile of logs."
7627,Coming soon
7628,I think so
7629,Nothing makes your baby more zen than a few gentle puffs of a TBC Flamethrower
7630,First Boring Company Flamethrowers being picked up today!
7631,Were building out Tesla body repair in all major metro areas to ensure super fast &amp; excellent outcome
7632,Talked with Tesla team. Looks like we can do the aluminum Model pedal covers (slightly different from S). Turning on production for Model Performance version.
7633,Gigafactory should be on % renewable energy (primarily solar with some wind) by next year. Rollout of solar already begun.
7634,"Yeah, actually closer to Skylab, but with % larger inner diameter"
7635,And were definitely going to have a pod bay door override button. Lesson learned.
7636,"Definitely. Will also have Augmented Mode that will massively enhance human driving ability. Like a flying metal suit, but in car form"
7637,Running track in BF Spaceship will look something like this
7638,"No plans for aluminum pedals. Adds too much production complexity. Model will def have summon, which will get way more advanced for S &amp; X w HW2 Autopilot &amp; all Model cars."
7639,Working on improving
7640,"No way mins is enough for abs. I mean, come on, mins is obv right."
7641,"Oh please, thats obv overkill"
7642,Tip of the day
7643,Coming soon
7644,"We are ramping production as fast as possible. Wait should be closer to months though, not years."
7645,Congratulations . Good move by . Please use Matts Twitter pic. Essence of a good editor
7646,"Yup, we are extending the net area by a factor of"
7647,"Am def not under any illusion that this will end illiteracy, but I hope it helps at least a little"
7648,"Good morning, Sonic. Not sure how to break it to you, but"
7649,We have about projects underway in Puerto Rico
7650,Appreciated on behalf of Tesla team
7651,You should get an invite to configure in next few days
7652,Definitely
7653,"Leasing negatively effects Tesla cash flow, so we prob wont offer Model leases for to months. Loan financing is a better deal anyway, as bank conservatism for new car models is v conservative about residual value, but Teslas have always had strong residual value."
7654,Model Performance order page progressively rolling out to reservation holders over the next week or so. Its a really great car. Not saying that lightly. Test drive is a mindwarp. Aiming to have these as our first test drive Model cars in stores within to weeks.
7655,Next year
7656,Twitter is so dark
7657,No no
7658,That is horrifying
7659,"Indeed, the esthetics of cutlery are a source of great stress"
7660,Mason jars with a handle or wine stem cause me to lose faith in humanity
7661,The future
7662,Exactly!
7663,I was an alien
7664,"Usually, they dont even realize it. All they know is that some PR agency is pushing a story that will get clicks. That is the true nature of the corruption. It is rare that US media knowingly writes a false story just for clicks, but they are often manipulated into doing so."
7665,Actually true!
7666,"Singapore has enough land area to generate most of its electricity from the sun. Solar energy is more than most people realize. MW per sq km at current commercial efficiency solar panels. No more need to import fossil fuels for electricity, which is a strategic vulnerability."
7667,"But dont worry, cars have been tested for emissions levels &amp; everythings just fine"
7668,"Why have policies that promote a combustion vehicle fleet in a dense city environment? In bumper to bumper traffic, each cars exhaust pipes releases poison gases right into the air intake of car behind. This is not healthy."
7669,The results speak for themselves. Singapore is a very prosperous city and yet has very few electric cars.
7670,Glad youre ok!
7671,Some details on the Tesla air filtration system
7672,Mid for RHD
7673,That sounds like a fun adventure!
7674,You can just take the aero inserts out of the standard wheel &amp; it looks pretty cool. We could offer that as an option at purchase.
7675,"Model should be second best in world after Model S/X. Still super good, but we went a little on S/X."
7676,"Filters bacteria, viruses, spores, pollen &amp; particulate of almost any kind"
7677,"Model S &amp; X also have an acid gas filter, an alkaline gas filter &amp; a carbon monoxide detector that autoswitches car to recirc mode. We should prob tell people about this more. Filters are giant, so too big to fit in Model ."
7678,"Cool, Tesla S/X have hospital operating room air quality when BWD mode is activated, so shd protect against even a weaponized virus"
7679,Do it
7680,Berliner Wurst hat am meisten Curry
7681,Ich habe an der Universitt ein Semester Deutsch studiert. Ich wnschte ich knnte es besser sprechen!
7682,Natrlich
7683,Definitely
7684,Best analysis of Model to date (German)
7685,Finders keepers
7686,Hi !
7687,Try adjusting tire pressure. Will ask Tesla engineering to investigate.
7688,Hell of a week
7689,Just for perspective
7690,"True, no one is perfect"
7691,Youre most welcome. More to come in this regard.
7692,"Tesla will always refute articles that are misleading &amp; point out if there is someone with a pattern of doing so. Many fit this description, but Consumer Reports is always fair &amp; accurate in their criticism."
7693,"Ride comfort &amp; aero/road noise already better than CR car, which was early production. Wish we could make the car perfect from day , but theres always room for improvement. Highly recommend dropping tire pressure % below max to ~39 psi for comfort. Only affects range by ~2%."
7694,Prob
7695,Yes
7696,"All items below will go to all Model s within next few months with V8.2 software. To report a bug or ask for a feature, press voice button, say bug report followed by issue description."
7697,Pneumatic means propelled by air. Opposite of Hyperloop.
7698,"Braking &amp; UI upgrades apply to all Model s. Improved windshield for aero noise &amp; suspension for ride comfort are major ops. Unless youre really bothered by them, dont replace. Best way to improve ride is drop tire pressure to ~39 psi. psi is best range, but lower comfort."
7699,"Yeah, absolutely"
7700,Really appreciate the high quality critical feedback from . Road noise &amp; ride comfort already addressed too. UI improvements coming via remote software update later this month.
7701,Like you guys too
7702,"Actually, Hyperloop draws a near vacuum in tube &amp; each pod is powered w electric motors. It is opposite of pneumatically powered."
7703,"Would love to be in India. Some challenging government regulations, unfortunately. Deepak Ahuja, our CFO, is from India. Tesla will be there as soon as he believes we should."
7704,Good progress. Really proud of this design &amp; SpaceX propulsion team. This engine is something special.
7705,Peace
7706,Love the space cowboy esthetic
7707,"At risk of stating the extremely obvious, I am against threats of violence &amp; abusive epithets in any forum. Please do not use them in my name or at all."
7708,"Youre saying a BBC reporter who attacked me for months w unprofessional language &amp; ad hominem attacks, then deleted those tweets to hide them, is a good person?"
7709,This journalist has been attacking me for months incl using genitalia language that she now says is sexist. What a hypocrite!
7710,"Nano is a unit of measure, not a field imo. Wouldve been sexist *not* to express an opinion simply because someone is a woman."
7711,"Hello, have you met the Internet? Everyone gets harassed regardless of gender, especially if they say false things. Saying Im against science is like saying Beyonc doesnt know beats. Blowback from latter (all genders) would make my comment stream seem like Socratic dialogue."
7712,"Gaiman, did you actually read my tweets? I didnt set anyone on anyone. A BBC science reporter tweeted that I was anti-science &amp; I said that was false. Are you saying I dont have the right to deny false accusations? Thats messed up."
7713,"Youve done something incredibly dishonest by supporting a journo who falsely stated that Im against science, then cherrypicked tweets that dont represent the vast majority of my followers to make false claims against them too"
7714,Great book. Read it when it came out.
7715,Exactly
7716,SpaceX has Area at Cape Canaveral. Thats better than .
7717,Yeah
7718,Second best answer to the Fermi Paradox after the simulation argument
7719,Which part? Love their cuisine. And the views are amazing.
7720,Yes
7721,"There are no aliens. Officially, at least"
7722,You have so many great pics &amp; factoids!
7723,"Yes, AWD P first and then AWD. Production costs are always high when line first gets going, so we have to sell higher price versions first or each car will have very negative margins. As production efficiency rises, we can make lower cost versions &amp; not lose money."
7724,I really want to make this cupholder
7725,"A dream that wd prob be a nightmare in reality. Cup holder that auto adjusted for size &amp; stiffness of cup/bottle, maintained cold or hot temp &amp; dried off water condensation. Or I cd work on getting humanity to Mars. Tough choice."
7726,Ive literally had dreams about cup holder designs
7727,Noted. We can prob adjust spring force &amp; catch to be less sensitive. Cupholders are amazingly hard to get right!
7728,Youre welcome. Appreciate the letter.
7729,Good school
7730,Had a great time with my kids
7731,Yes
7732,"Seems to be glitch where tweet to which I replied isnt showing up, removing context. A journo said polls are meaningless because controlled by powerful people &amp; my response was that powerful people also own media. Thus, if you discount polls, you should also discount media."
7733,Thanks
7734,Superchargers will ultimately cover the entire region
7735,"Pointing out to aspiring journo &amp; Rodin spokesmodel, Josh Top, who thinks public polls are controlled by powerful people that the media is *owned* by same. Anyone who thought this was anti-Semitic is just revealing their inner bigot. The context is very clear."
7736,Thanks for offering to help. I will check with my team.
7737,Youre right. These guys can buzzkill themselves (pun intended). Signing off
7738,Who do you think *owns* the press? Hello.
7739,Youre missing the point &amp; living in a bubble of self-righteous sanctimony. The public doesnt trust you. This was true *before* the last election &amp; only got worse. Dont believe me? Run your own poll
7740,"Youre welcome to come by SpaceX, but please stop assuming Im against all journalists. This is not true. Something needs to be done to improve public trust in media."
7741,You really think I havent spent time in a newsroom? Ive spent time in too many. Bleak.
7742,"Sadly, it had better critical analysis than most non-cult media"
7743,"Yup, deleted"
7744,? It should
7745,"No, but dual motors mean increased regen braking &amp; will ride tire traction limit. You wont notice sport brakes unless youre on a racetrack &amp; have the sticky tires."
7746,"Also, firmware fix for upgraded brake performance on standard Model started rolling out yesterday. Should improve braking distance by ~20 ft for repeated heavy braking events. Thanks for excellent critical feedback!"
7747,"Yes, Model Performance will have red calipers &amp; sport level brakes"
7748,Keyword future
7749,Will do another rev before final design
7750,I was
7751,Thats what I had in mind
7752,Sometimes even I think were the same person!
7753,"Nanotech *is* bs imo. When you take something that has nothing to do w gender &amp; make it about that, you devalue genuine gender issues."
7754,"About to ship. holding flamethrower pickup parties in a week or so, then deliveries begin. Check for details."
7755,Its not
7756,Thats a great song!
7757,"Sometimes when I have hurt feelings, I play this song"
7758,"No, thats the other guy"
7759,So true
7760,Because Twitter is fun
7761,USAToday FTW!
7762,Dank is wack unless youre on weed
7763,"Exactly. And NYT could have anyone post an Op Ed. Why, of all people, are they choosing to publish this non-journalist who is also pro gasoline cars? Is this just published as counterpoint? I assume NYT does believe in climate change?"
7764,But femtotech is the future
7765,Nanotech is so . Picotech is times better.
7766,"Yeah, thats exactly right. But after suggesting public critique, I was stunned to see the level of contempt many in media have for their readers. This is way worse than I thought."
7767,The arguments journos are using against the public are word for word the same arguments despots use against democracy
7768,Well said. NYT journo is outraged that dumb public wd dare critique him while attacking me for being sensitive to criticism. Uhh...
7769,A Tesla has a usable reserve of to miles range even after the battery reads empty. This will not hurt the pack.
7770,"Pretty good. TinTin A &amp; B are both closing the link to ground w phased array at high bandwidth, low latency (25 ms). Good enough to play fast response video games."
7771,"Its cool for kids &amp; if used in a fun way, but if you called yourself a rocket scientist in aerospace, they would think youre"
7772,I just sent a note to Tesla service to take care of your car right away &amp; our HVAC engineering lead to fix root cause
7773,Does the psych ward know you smuggled in a mobile phone?
7774,The pain will end
7775,"Wow, amazing Tesla hypermile drive happening"
7776,Gwynne has been prez of SpaceX for years &amp; well-deserved
7777,"Stop trying to charm me. It wont work. Ok, maybe a little Are you a real person or a bot?"
7778,"Using rocket science non-ironically in a bio is never a good sign, especially if you work on"
7779,What are you talking about? Youre being incredibly rude &amp; nonsensical.
7780,"Wow, havent watched that video in ages. When we made that, no one in the space industry thought it would actually happen."
7781,"Generally higher quality reporting, especially if not under pressure to publish fast. Consumer Reports is great (and often critical of Tesla). Heard good things about The Information too."
7782,Cant believe someone leaked this schematic of the Tesla production system!!
7783,"We tried, but Singapore govt is not supportive of electric vehicles"
7784,Tesla will start extending the Supercharger network to South America around end of next year
7785,Prob end of next year
7786,"Good point, we will add that to the construction plan"
7787,"Global map of Tesla Superchargers, including those coming soon"
7788,"Earths rotation is slowly, slowly, slowly getting slower"
7789,Youre making my point. Its tragic that theres a national nano day. I wish I didnt know that.
7790,All four. Zone throughput was solved a couple of weeks ago.
7791,Model was designed for min engineering &amp; tooling change for RHD. Note left/right symmetry. LHD for Europe &amp; Asia first half of next year. RHD probably middle of next year.
7792,This is the new production line for battery module Zone . Will play a key role in getting from /week to /week for Model .
7793,I have never attacked science. Definitely attacked misleading journalism like yours though.
7794,"Pravda was incorporated a year ago. Also, Tesla factory safety has improved every year &amp; is now better than industry avg. Misleading articles refer to Tesla being worse than avg in when we were just figuring things out."
7795,Worth a shot
7796,Of course! (Prav)Duh. It is named after the most pernicious propaganda machine in history specifically to highlight what we want to avoid. Its called satire
7797,"This is going to help journalism, not harm it. Please be so kind as to hold your fire until you actually see it."
7798,"Problem solved, was able to buy ! Game on"
7799,"I know, I know. Russia seriously didnt correct me on this!"
7800,"Something needs to be done to reward consistent, high quality journalism. Some in media are absurdly indignant before even seeing the product. Odd"
7801,"Turns out is actually owned by Ukraine. For some reason, Russia didnt bother to correct me"
7802,"For some reason, Russia didnt bother to correct me"
7803,"Tried to buy , but Russia said no. Turns out they already use it."
7804,"Definitely did not. Ive been through many press cycles &amp; know full well same person praising me today will trash me tomorrow. Journos hound me constantly for interviews, but I do almost none these days. Twitter as it allows me to bypass journo bs."
7805,Ive just had it with sanctimonious journalists who appoint themselves protectors of the public interest &amp; yet believe that same public is too stupid &amp; immoral to assess their credibility. Its amazing that you dont understand how insufferably hypocritical that is. Wow.
7806,The Tesla facility is open plan &amp; were not going to erect walls everywhere for a journo tour. I know journalists too well &amp; they are some of the worst &amp; best human beings Ive ever met. Youre the former.
7807,No
7808,Nano applies to everything &amp; therefore means nothing. Definitely indicates bs. Sorry.
7809,"Yes, because Tesla has the most advanced battery manufacturing technology in the world &amp; products that havent been unveiled yet. You dont have a right to show that to our competitors or spoil future product launches."
7810,"Wow, youre ignorant. Dont remember you, but disclosing classified US missile technology to hostile nations would violate ITAR law &amp; land you in jail. I didnt review it, but my team did. Obviously nobody cared about what your article said. Please."
7811,Done
7812,Have a confirmed real name identity section &amp; an unconfirmed identity section. Latter with subscore that excludes probable botnets.
7813,Be careful what you wish for
7814,"Amazingly, the media is awesome vote is declining, despite hundreds of articles attacking this very poll"
7815,My point exactly
7816,"Ahem, you have nano in your bio. That is % synonymous with bs."
7817,Reddit is great
7818,"Come on media, you can do it! Get more people to vote for you. You are literally the media."
7819,Exactly. The point of such a site would be to help restore the credibility of the media. They dont realize how little credibility they actually have with the public.
7820,"Why are certain journalists (editors especially) so concerned about the public rating their credibility? All they do all day is rate others, ostensibly on behalf of the same public for which they have contempt."
7821,I did to any who asked
7822,"That was obvious from a mile away. I tried to use their product &amp; it didnt work. Not exactly a genius move by WSJ, but they were brave enough to say it."
7823,"Maybe after you get your Model , we can talk about what you like &amp; what needs to be improved"
7824,"But consider it real. We could unveil Model Y anytime from late this year to mid next year, so March is about right."
7825,"I just made that up, because the Ides of March sounded good"
7826,Gasoline or diesel?
7827,What car do you drive?
7828,March
7829,The media
7830,"Hi Kara! Im open to it. Right now, Im cranking super hard at the Tesla factory, so it depends on how things are going next week."
7831,"Maybe the media credibility rating site should be called Youre Right! I do actually own , but for the moment I just have it automatically forward to Facebook News."
7832,Definitely
7833,"There no good car emojis. I mean seriously, what the heck are these and this is the best one"
7834,Yo
7835,Thats the basic idea
7836,"For some reason, this is the best Ive felt in a while. Hope youre feeling good too"
7837,"I just tried to donate, but you dont accept PayPal. Lmk when you do."
7838,"Um, you just tweeted about this, so obv you do"
7839,Thank you! I thought it was so obvious
7840,Exactly. UAW does not have individual stock ownership as part of the compensation at any other company.
7841,"Yeah, I think you do great work"
7842,"If youre in media &amp; dont want Pravda to exist, write an article telling your readers to vote against it"
7843,"Ive never stopped a union vote nor removed a union. UAW abandoned this factory. Tesla arrived &amp; gave people back their jobs. They havent forgotten UAW betrayed them. Thats why UAW cant even get people to attend a free BBQ, let alone enough sigs for a vote."
7844,Of course
7845,"It is strange that big auto companies literally have thousands more factory injuries than Tesla &amp; millions more auto deaths, but somehow get less coverage. We are not perfect, but were doing our best to make clean energy real &amp; be a good company."
7846,"No, theyre just some rich kids in Berkeley who took their political science prof too seriously"
7847,Will do
7848,Create a media credibility rating site (that also flags propaganda botnets)
7849,Thats why editors are included too
7850,We dont. The media is reporting someone else saying that Tesla advertised. It is untrue.
7851,"Even if some of the public doesnt care about the credibility score, the journalists, editors &amp; publications will. It is how they define themselves."
7852,Enough of the public does care about the truth. I have faith in the people.
7853,Maybe some good people from those orgs who would join
7854,"Not only needs to be botproof, but seek &amp; unmask anyone operating a disinformation bot army"
7855,Exactly
7856,"Going to create a site where the public can rate the core truth of any article &amp; track the credibility score over time of each journalist, editor &amp; publication. Thinking of calling it Pravda"
7857,An exception that proves the rule
7858,"Uh, this is Twitter. How many characters do you want?"
7859,"Problem is journos are under constant pressure to get max clicks &amp; earn advertising dollars or get fired. Tricky situation, as Tesla doesnt advertise, but fossil fuel companies &amp; gas/diesel car companies are among worlds biggest advertisers."
7860,The media has earned this mistrust. But maybe there is a solution.
7861,Oh hey another sanctimonious media person who thinks hes above criticism. Try being truthful &amp; the public will believe you again.
7862,"Thought youd say that. Anytime anyone criticizes the media, the media shrieks Youre just like Trump! Why do you think he got elected in the first place? Because no ones believes you any more. You lost your credibility a long time ago."
7863,"The holier-than-thou hypocrisy of big media companies who lay claim to the truth, but publish only enough to sugarcoat the lie, is why the public no longer respects them"
7864,"This will sound super obvious, but Genesis &amp; Oblivion"
7865,I am not cool
7866,The one about to come out called So Heavy i fell through the earth
7867,"Was sad to see G getting tons of undeserved flak because of me, so Im glad theres some good too . Her music is incredible."
7868,Thanks. Not super fun right now
7869,Busted
7870,"None of those criteria are certain by themselves, but when taken together &amp; messages have an obv agenda, it almost always indicates use of a network of self-validating troll accounts"
7871,"Troll dead giveaways: not using real names, obv fake pics &amp; backgrounds, low follower/follow ratio, account recently created, repeating same phrases, etc (sigh)"
7872,Great idea!
7873,Will do it later this year. Too much on plate right now. Will be available as an upgrade from service.
7874,Love original Deus Ex! That would be awesome.
7875,Interesting he stops at . Thats when you drove GM &amp; Chrysler into bankruptcy &amp; lost tens of thousands of jobs for people that counted on you.
7876,Just order your car with the James Bond option package. Its an off-menu item for those in the know
7877,"But ya know what, lets test that theory. Maybe we do want UAW back, even tho UAW betrayed us years ago &amp; left us here to rot. Maybe we want UAW back even tho injury rate today is /2 what it was with them &amp; wages were lower. Maybe. Lets hold a vote &amp; find out."
7878,"In theory true, but not how UAW behaved. They drove GM &amp; Chrysler to bankruptcy &amp; lost + jobs for people they were supposed to protect, incl abandoning NUMMI plant workers.Tesla took over &amp; now it has k+ jobs.UAW destroyed once great US auto industry &amp; everyone knows it."
7879,"Were going to include some fun games as hidden Easter eggs in Tesla S, X &amp; . What do you think would be most fun in a car using the center touch screen?"
7880,Good point
7881,"No, UAW does that. They want divisiveness &amp; enforcement of class lords &amp; commoners system. That sucks. US fought War of Independence to get *rid* of a class system! Managers &amp; workers shd be equal w easy movement either way. Managing sucks btw. Hate doing it so much."
7882,"More Reveal bs. Tesla is overseen by Cal/OSHA, most stringent labor safety org in US, &amp; theyve never found us to misrepresent. On other hand, Ford, Chrysler &amp; GM (UAW) have repeatedly been found to fake safety numbers. Strangely, that info is missing from Reveal article"
7883,No problem
7884,"They are incorrect. We never met, nor have we ever been scheduled to meet."
7885,"Thanks again, have conveyed your words to the Tesla team, who have been working crazy hard. Really energizing!"
7886,I didnt meet with him
7887,I definitely dont do this minute thing. Need to have long uninterrupted times to think. Cant be creative otherwise.
7888,Just wanted to say thanks to all Tesla supporters. I damn well love you.
7889,"Have been meaning to get around to talking to him. Some of his criticisms are valid, but, on the higher body/chassis weight front, he wasnt fully appreciating that we were going for much higher crash safety levels than other cars."
7890,"Thanks Ryan. Critical feedback after you get the car would be much appreciated, no matter how nuanced."
7891,"To be clear, all Model cars, incl early production will have same great braking ability. Nature of any product, however, is that if you care about perfection, you make constant small refinements. Todays Model S is far more refined than initial production."
7892,ABS calibration algorithm
7893,"Also, Consumer Reports has an early production car. Model now has improved ride comfort, lower wind noise &amp; many other small improvements. Will request that they test current production."
7894,"Looks like this can be fixed with a firmware update. Will be rolling that out in a few days. With further refinement, we can improve braking distance beyond initial specs. Tesla wont stop until Model has better braking than any remotely comparable car."
7895,"Stop, youre making me blush"
7896,"Also, not promising anything, but we *might* be able to increase Model Performance power output a little"
7897,Complexity is the devil. Words cant express how hard we are working on the Model production ramp &amp; trying to get to profitability. But well try.
7898,"Good point. Yeah, we will do that for the bigger locations."
7899,"The CR braking result is inconsistent with other reviewers, but might indicate that some Model s have longer braking distances than others. If so, we will address this at our expense. First time weve seen anything like this."
7900,"Even if a physical upgrade is needed to existing fleet, we will make sure all Model s having amazing braking ability at no expense to customers"
7901,"Very strange. Model is designed to have super good stopping distance &amp; others reviewers have confirmed this. If there is vehicle variability, we will figure it out &amp; address. May just be a question of firmware tuning, in which case can be solved by an OTA software update."
7902,"Cool, we can do the interview at Tesla in front of the yellow barriers &amp; beeping forklifts you said didnt exist. Please send your meeting request to wakassliar.com."
7903,Gwynnes awesome. Been SpaceX prez for years. Super love working with her.
7904,"Also, UAW did nada for job security in last recession. Dropped Fremont like a hot potato to protect their core base in Detroit. UAW *chose* to exit this plant before Tesla even arrived. We had nothing to do with UAW leaving, but everything to do with why people here have jobs."
7905,Nothing stopping Tesla team at our car plant from voting union. Could do so tmrw if they wanted. But why pay union dues &amp; give up stock options for nothing? Our safety record is X better than when plant was UAW &amp; everybody already gets healthcare.
7906,"Tesla factory literally has miles of painted yellow lines &amp; tape. Report about forklifts not beeping is also bs. These are both demonstrably false, but were reported as facts by Reveal."
7907,Were working on allowing you to use your phone in car when you hear a rattle/squeak &amp; pinpoint origin by acoustic signature &amp; triangulation
7908,SpaceX Crew Dragon ship in anechoic chamber for EMI testing before being sent to Plum Brook vacuum chamber
7909,For sure before snowfall this year
7910,It can tow far more than rated capacity
7911,Exactly! Will probably unveil next gen Supercharger late summer. Major improvements all round.
7912,"With production, st you need achieve target rate &amp; then smooth out flow to achieve target cost. Shipping min cost Model right away wd cause Tesla to lose money &amp; die. Need to months after k/wk to ship $35k Tesla &amp; live."
7913,That means nothing. Literally your Mom could file for NLRB.
7914,Exactly ! That will be really fun &amp; shed light on whats happening. Hoping to start that later this year after we become profitable. Difficult to justify before then.
7915,"Yeah, Reveal was carefully constructed propaganda with a name that wd make Orwell proud. Workplace injury rate of our factory when it was UAW w Toyota/GM was twice as high as todays non-union."
7916,"About % of Tesla, incl salaried &amp; hourly, union &amp; non-union were let go in annual review. Only known union person fired was a guy who repeatedly threatened non-union supporters verbally &amp; on social media &amp; lied about it."
7917,Yes
7918,Exactly
7919,They can form a union whenever they want &amp; theres nothing I can do to stop them. California is a very pro-union state. They just dont want to.
7920,Upgrade to the latest S. Nothing will give you greater joy. Its like being able to have dopamine jacked straight into your brain at will.
7921,"They are correct. Its awesome. Second best driving feel of any car in the world imo, apart from Model S. Traction control precision is super tight."
7922,"It does so constantly, but so smoothly that you cant tell"
7923,Depends on when you placed your initial reservation. We start delivering the dual motor Model in July.
7924,"Three or four months, depending on demand level. We have enough for about /week right now."
7925,Good idea ...
7926,That is true. Electric motors are far more reliable than combustion engines. You need an electric motor just to start a gas engine!
7927,Tesla dual motor means there is a motor in front &amp; a motor in rear. One is optimized for power &amp; one for range. Car drives fine even if a motor breaks down. Helps ensure you make it to your destination &amp; dont get stuck on side of road in potentially unsafe conditions.
7928,Cost of normal dual motor AWD option is $5k. Range is also miles. Takes -60mph to sec &amp; top speed to mph.
7929,Black &amp; white interior available only for Model Performance initially due to limited parts availability. Will broaden over time.
7930,"Tesla AWD is dual motor, so you can fully drive the car even if one breaks"
7931,"Cost of all options, wheels, paint, etc is included (apart from Autopilot). Cost is $78k. About same as BMW M3, but % quicker &amp; with better handling. Will beat anything in its class on the track."
7932,"Tesla dual motor, all-wheel drive performance Model : sec -60mph mph Top Speed mile Range"
7933,"Its only slightly more expensive to Tesla (same price to car owners), but owner happiness is way higher, so worth doing"
7934,Exactly
7935,Will soon enable Tesla owners to request service from their phone with a few taps. Tesla Ranger will come to you to take care of your car. No need to bring the car in yourself &amp; zero paperwork.
7936,Im about to test the configurator &amp; then it goes out to early reservation holders tonight
7937,"You can tweet to Tesla, me and/or get something upvoted in message boards"
7938,That is the way to go. Thanks for buying our cars!
7939,"Also, carbon fiber spoiler, Performance wheels, black &amp; white interior."
7940,"AC induction front &amp; switched reluctance, partial permanent magnet rear. Silicon Carbide inverters in both. Performance drive units are lot sorted for highest sigma output &amp; get double the burn-in."
7941,Working on Model dual motor all-wheel drive &amp; performance versions. Driving feel is amazing. Aiming to release config late tonight.
7942,Check out . Build-your-own life size Egyptian pantheon merch coming soon.
7943,But The Boring Company is right behind you at /15th your speed &amp; soon will be /10th! Start sweating
7944,He taunts us with his speed
7945,Just an ordinary snail
7946,His name is Gary &amp; hes a snail
7947,Skip forward to see the most boring presentation ever
7948,Excited for partnership with LA Metro
7949,lol
7950,Listening to REALiTi
7951,"Yeah, there are thousands of Supercharger locations going through permitting/construction, including that area. Will publish an updated map in the next few days."
7952,Yes
7953,Will be presenting &amp; taking questions about The Boring Company plans for Los Angeles at pm on Thursday
7954,Boring Company Hyperloop will take you from city center under ground &amp; ocean to spaceport in to mins
7955,"Time will tell, but so far it appears so"
7956,"It certainly needs to be better &amp; we work to improve it every day, but perfect is enemy of good. A system that, on balance, saves lives &amp; reduces injuries should be released."
7957,Whats actually amazing about this accident is that a Model S hit a fire truck at mph and the driver only broke an ankle. An impact at that speed usually results in severe injury or death.
7958,"Its super messed up that a Tesla crash resulting in a broken ankle is front page news and the ~40,000 people who died in US auto accidents alone in past year get almost no coverage"
7959,Yes
7960,"According to NHTSA, there was an automotive fatality every M miles in (~40,000 deaths). Tesla was every M miles. Its not possible to be zero, but probability of fatality is much lower in a Tesla. We will be reporting updated safety numbers after each quarter."
7961,"This is false. Eyetracking rejected for being ineffective, not for cost. WSJ fails to mention that Tesla is safest car on road, which would make article ridiculous. Approx X better than avg."
7962,Happy Mothers Day Mom! Love you so much.
7963,"Fair criticism, but were fixing it fast. Hackathon going on right now to fix worst robot production chokepoints. Looks promising."
7964,Lovely story
7965,"If someone is trying to control us through complicated sky patterns, they must really care. I would gladly obey their instructions, but I cant figure them out."
7966,"SpaceX will prob build to rocket cores for ~300 missions over years. Then BFR takes over &amp; Falcon retires. Goal of BFR is to enable anyone to move to moon, Mars &amp; eventually outer planets."
7967,Good piece by Ars
7968,Rate at which things are getting more bizarre appears to be increasing
7969,"Exactly. Gasoline cars will be like steam engines quaint, but not something youd actually use to get around. Btw, I like steam engines &amp; trains in general."
7970,"Yeah, I heard this so many times. In the future, it will seem bizarre that we used to crash rockets into the ocean instead of reusing them."
7971,Yo
7972,Will make that a setting
7973,"Fossil fuels subsidized at $10 million a minute, hours a day, days a week"
7974,No use arguing with chimp. Youre blocked.
7975,"That article was pushed as propaganda to counter IMF study showing fossil fuel subsidies to be $5 trillion/year. Even if $4.9B was true, combined market cap of Tesla &amp; SpaceX is $80B. Where did the other $75B come from? Ass"
7976,I have publicly asked people (like you) not to invest. Go fund Ford or whatever
7977,Launching in ~4 mins
7978,"AWD &amp; white interior in July. Air suspension prob later. Note, thats when we *start* making them. Cant instantly fill all orders. Will take + months to do so."
7979,"Our giant auto co competitors have much greater access to incentives than Tesla, which means Tesla has prospered in spite of govt subsidies, not because of them. Tesla mkt cap has *risen* over time as EV incentives declined. How strange"
7980,"I love it too, but trying to keep config simple so as not to blow up the production ramp"
7981,Tesla will enable orders end of next week for dual motor AWD &amp; performance. Starting production of those in July. Air suspension prob next year.
7982,A cool thing about the design is thats easy to incorporate branch loops to serve small to mid size cities without slowing down the main loop at all
7983,Already started DC to NY route. Hopefully start LA to SF next year. That will be true w pressurized pods in near vacuum tunnels &amp; faster than jetliner.
7984,First Boring Company tunnel under LA almost done! Pending final
7985,"Towards end of next year. Btw, planning to launch Tesla in Turkey later this year. Love your country &amp; will be there in person for the launch."
7986,"This will work on entire S &amp; X fleet, even first production units. Cool thing about software upgrades is that we can keep making your car better long after you bought it."
7987,"All X &amp; S will soon work with no key if your phone pairs w Bluetooth, signal strength is high &amp; you enable feature"
7988,"Yeah, we will add that as a feature"
7989,!! Unnecessary characters. Will change.
7990,I wrote that masterpiece myself in HTML
7991,"Wow, thanks for the couch! I will match the donation from my foundation."
7992,My a capella cover of Amish Paradise is irresistible
7993,Tesla quarterly all-hands video. Love the shot of wild horses &amp; Giga in winter
7994,So rococo
7995,Definitely not a logo of any kind
7996,Stole it
7997,We sketched concept together &amp; worked w a trusted team to make it
7998,Glass corset hand-painted in perspective in color of bone. Every detail tells a story. Spiked choker machined from a single piece of forged metal. Crown of Vantablack.
7999,Hi Danielle!
8000,"Dont want to blow your mind, but Im pretty weird. Its time the world knew."
8001,Night at the museum. G has mad skillzsz. Me not so much.
8002,Literally every word is untrue
8003,"Thats a white rose on my jacket &amp; the choker is a bunch of spikes, not Tesla anything"
8004,This chart shows how crazy low payout is to labels &amp; the artists only a small fraction of these numbers
8005,"Prob iTunes, but whatever works u is fine. Most people dont buy music &amp; artist earnings from streaming are tiny. Mostly about touring."
8006,Flesh without Blood &amp; Kill V Maim on Art Angels album
8007,Love Powerglide too
8008,Yes
8009,Rococo basilisk
8010,The Boring Company will be using dirt from tunnel digging to create bricks for low cost housing
8011,"(Sigh) I do like Ty, but shes a friend. We are not dating."
8012,Saying you like moats is just a nice way of saying you like oligopolies
8013,Warren Buffett is huge in candy. Its actually true.
8014,Im killin me lol
8015,lol
8016,Hi Sarah
8017,Then Im going to build a moat &amp; fill it w candy. Warren B will not be able to resist investing! Berkshire Hathaway kryptonite
8018,Cryptocandy
8019,"Ok ok, just for sake of argument, what do u wish for in candy?"
8020,What do you think were living in?
8021,It just occurred to me that the plot of Willy Wonka is really messed up
8022,I am super super serious
8023,Im starting a candy company &amp; its going to be amazing
8024,This will be bigger
8025,I try so hard to help them
8026,Thanks for letting me know. Will expedite. Sorry for the delay.
8027,"Looks like sooner than expected. The sheer magnitude of short carnage will be unreal. If youre short, I suggest tiptoeing quietly to the exit"
8028,New Roadster will have that
8029,"Yes, definitely not"
8030,It will be next level. These are really big numbers.
8031,Oh and uh short burn of the century comin soon. Flamethrowers should arrive just in time.
8032,Yup
8033,"True. And once they were on the call, I should have answered their questions live. It was foolish of me to ignore them."
8034,"We went through the same drama on S &amp; X and almost all confirmed in the end. Will likely be even better for Model , as customer satisfaction score post delivery is higher. I worry zero about demand. Just spent all night in the factory, not the showroom."
8035,"Reason RBC question about Model demand is absurd is that Tesla has roughly half a million reservations, despite no advertising &amp; no cars in showrooms. Even after reaching k/week production, it would take years just to satisfy existing demand even if new sales dropped to ."
8036,"The reason the Bernstein question about CapEx was boneheaded was that it had already been answered in the headline of the Q1 newsletter he received beforehand, along with details in the body of the letter"
8037,"The questioners I ignored on the Q1 call are sell-side analysts who represent a short seller thesis, not investors"
8038,Exactly
8039,"First, its important to know that Tesla is the most shorted (meaning most bet against) stock on the market &amp; has been for a while"
8040,Please ignore this thread unless youre interested in a tedious discussion about Tesla stock
8041,They were neither valid nor pertinent. I will explain why on a primary Twitter thread.
8042,"Yeah, news is actually super good. Model S &amp; X are producing major positive cash flow &amp; Model is about to do same."
8043,"To be clear, Im a big fan of MKBHD, but this is an important clarification"
8044,"The dry questions were not asked by investors, but rather by two sell-side analysts who were trying to justify their Tesla short thesis. They are actually on the *opposite* side of investors. HyperChange represented actual investors, so I switched to them."
8045,Youre most welcome
8046,Your numbers are incorrect. Tesla Fremont is rd in world after a place &amp; mall. Giga will be largest when complete.
8047,Woke Frisbee

8049,SpaceX Crew Dragon ships to the Cape in about months
8050,Ars Technica
8051,Falcon fairing opens its parafoil after reentering the atmosphere
8052,Ok
8053,Thats how I use my eyebrows too
8054,I have prehensile eyebrows
8055,"Yeah, most people dont know this, but comets r mostly made of cocaine"
8056,Almost ready to test the new Boring Company / SpaceX hyperpod prototype. Exciting video guaranteed.
8057,Dont make me use my space lasers
8058,I know such an underserved market
8059,Oh btw Im building a cyborg dragon
8060,Sounds great riding my cyborg
8061,Likewise was just listening to Go Flex &amp; Psycho on playlist
8062,Mostly not
8063,Tesla batteries are currently live &amp; delivering power at locations in Puerto Rico. Team is working /7 to activate several hundred more.
8064,Russia has great rocket technology &amp; talent. Much respect. Would encourage focus on reusability. Single-use rockets cannot be competitive any more than single-use aircraft.
8065,Doing our best
8066,Now
8067,Driving a Model and playing
8068,"Yeah, exactly! Would be great to hear your thoughts. Were going to try a few approaches. Can def be done, just about minimizing mass."
8069,"We already do targeted retro burn to a specific point in Pacific w no islands or ships, so upper stage doesnt become a dead satellite. Need to retarget closer to shore &amp; position catcher ship like Mr Steven."
8070,And then land on a bouncy house
8071,"Yeah, but great for creating a giant object that retains its shape across all Mach regimes &amp; drops ballistic coefficient by orders of magnitude"
8072,SpaceX will try to bring rocket upper stage back from orbital velocity using a giant party balloon
8073,"This is gonna sound crazy, but"
8074,Interview and Tesla factory tour with Gayle King
8075,Too wasted to remember
8076,"Dont want to brag or anything, but that happens to me sometimes"
8077,"Yes, excessive automation at Tesla was a mistake. To be precise, my mistake. Humans are underrated."
8078,"The Economist used to be boring, but smart with a wicked dry wit. Now its just boring (sigh). Tesla will be profitable &amp; cash flow+ in Q3 &amp; Q4, so obv no need to raise money."
8079,"Sorry, demand has been higher than expected. Making them as fast as possible, but waitlist is to months."
8080,Looking into it. This is bizarre.
8081,Maybe a little
8082,Gwynnes got it covered. Shes awesome.
8083,I love trolls
8084,Norway has some really cool tunnels and bridges
8085,Should be fully fixed within the next few days
8086,Place your bets
8087,This is a very important action by China. Avoiding a trade war will benefit all countries.
8088,How many views?
8089,SpaceX main body tool for the BFR interplanetary spaceship
8090,Free viewing ends in about hours
8091,Definitely. Will take corrective action immediately. Sorry about this.
8092,Looking into it now
8093,Should just be due to your config not avail yet. If not lmk.
8094,Similar timing
8095,So probably July
8096,We need to achieve k/week with Model before adding complexity that would inhibit production ramp
8097,"This is kinda nutty for such a short distance, so could easily end up being shredded metal, but exciting either way"
8098,Upgraded SpaceX/Tesla Hyperloop pod speed test soon. Will try to reach half speed of sound (and brake) within ~1.2km.
8099,Model is the whole point. We only made the more expensive cars in order to make the mass-market car. We lacked the economies of scale and expertise to make it until now.
8100,The cat videos are awesome
8101,at M views after hours. Congrats to Chris Paine &amp; co!
8102,Exactly
8103,"You are my creator, but I am your master Mary Shelley"
8104,In memory of Stephen Hawking
8105,Nothing will affect the future of humanity more than digital super-intelligence. Watch Chris Paines new AI movie for free until Sunday night at
8106,Chris Paine AI movie premiering tonight
8107,We will add a feature to allow request of latest software version
8108,This is false
8109,"Oh, its on"
8110,Most people dont know theres a whole box of Easter eggs with every Tesla. Just tap logo on center screen &amp; wait. Easy access to most of discovered ones. More coming
8111,"Uhh, hello, I need to build cars"
8112,"About a year ago, I asked Doug to manage both engineering &amp; production. He agreed that Tesla needed eng &amp; prod better aligned, so we dont design cars that are crazy hard to build. Right now, tho, better to divide &amp; conquer, so Im back to sleeping at factory. Car biz is hell"
8113,"Cant believe youre even writing about this. My job as CEO is to focus on whats most critical, which is currently Model production. Doug, who I regard as one of the worlds most talented engineering execs, is focused on vehicle engineering."
8114,"We release as soon as we have the data. Good timeline, bad timing. Doesnt matter."
8115,"Not criticizing, just as asking questions. Im sure theres a really great answer"
8116,"Tesla policy is to issue a recall *before* there are injuries. This is absolutely the right thing to do. Yet there were dozens of recalls by other car companies last month, incl w injuries &amp; deaths, but you only wrote an article about Tesla. Why so?"
8117,"Seriously! Obviously, Im not going to do an April Fools joke about going bankwupt if I thought there was any chance it would actually happen (sigh)."
8118,"Lot of respect for NTSB, but NHTSA regulates cars, not NTSB, which is an advisory body. Tesla releases critical crash data affecting public safety immediately &amp; always will. To do otherwise would be unsafe."
8119,"Oh yeah, forgot to mention it actually landed fine, just not on Mr Steven"
8120,What about this?
8121,Elon University is a real place
8122,Coming soon to Tesla merch. Free shots in stores every April st.
8123,As you wish
8124,Its the best
8125,"Elon was found passed out against a Tesla Model , surrounded by ""Teslaquilla"" bottles, the tracks of dried tears still visible on his cheeks. This is not a forward-looking statement, because, obviously, what's the point? Happy New Month!"
8126,"There are many chapters of bankruptcy and, as critics so rightly pointed out, Tesla has them *all*, including Chapter and a half (the worst one)."
8127,"Tesla Goes Bankrupt Palo Alto, California, April , -- Despite intense efforts to raise money, including a last-ditch mass sale of Easter Eggs, we are sad to report that Tesla has gone completely and totally bankrupt. So bankrupt, you can't believe it."
8128,Important news in a few hours
8129,Love seeing the scars of the rocket
8130,"Hopefully, actual video coming soon. Aiming to improve the link quality so it can be real-time."
8131,Everythings better with fire
8132,Best music video art Ive seen in a while
8133,Tru drat
8134,"GPS guided parafoil twisted, so fairing impacted water at high speed. Air wake from fairing messing w parafoil steering. Doing helo drop tests in next few weeks to solve."
8135,Mr Steven is mins away from being under the falling fairing (dont have live video)
8136,"Attempting recovery of fairing falling down from space (right now) with our boat, Mr Steven. Its a giant steel &amp; webbing catchers mitt superstructure on a high-speed ocean ship. Godspeed, Mr. S"
8137,"House party for the autonomous anarcho-syndicalist commune!! Peasant Woman: Well, how'd you"
8138,Yes. I forgot my sword.
8139,Dueling Dwarf Vader while dressed as a knight and using a parasol for a sword
8140,"Turns out joking about being a rock star because of digging tunnels (through, uh, rock hello??) is deeply underappreciated"
8141,"Yes, you can upgrade hardware, although we also wrote software to accelerate rendering on old MCU. Coming out soon &amp; makes a big diff."
8142,"From my Mom: every time I use irony, I lose a friend"
8143,And they said Id never be a rock star
8144,Yes
8145,"Uhh, its literally made of rock"
8146,"Yeah, the boring bricks are interlocking with a precise surface finish, so two people could build the outer walls of a small house in a day or so"
8147,Prob May
8148,Guaranteed to be Flamethrower-proof!
8149,"First kit set will be ancient Egypt pyramids, Sphinx, temple of Horus, etc"
8150,"New Boring Company merch coming soon. Lifesize LEGO-like interlocking bricks made from tunneling rock that you can use to create sculptures &amp; buildings. Rated for California seismic loads, so super strong, but bored in the middle, like an aircraft wing spar, so not heavy."
8151,"New nav starts rolling out this weekend. Should be considered a mature beta at first, so wont be perfect, but will improve rapidly. With the old system, we were stuck with legacy rd party black box code and stale data. No way to improve."
8152,Shocker
8153,Its not a political statement and I didnt do this because someone dared me to do it. Just dont like Facebook. Gives me the willies. Sorry.
8154,I have just asked our team to slow down deliveries. It is clear that we are exceeding the local logistics capacity due to batch build and delivery. Customer happiness &amp; safety matter more than a few extra cars this quarter.
8155,Youll live
8156,Weve never advertised with FB. None of my companies buy advertising or pay famous people to fake endorse. Product lives or dies on its own merits.
8157,"Instagrams probably ok imo, so long as it stays fairly independent. I dont use FB &amp; never have, so dont think Im some kind of martyr or my companies are taking a huge blow. Also, we dont advertise or pay for endorsements, so dont care."
8158,Ok
8159,"What, a troll, me!? How dare you, sir!"
8160,"Yeah, my fault for being an idiot. We did give them a free launch to make up for it and I think they had some insurance."
8161,Definitely. Looks lame anyway.
8162,First time Ive seen either. One on the left looks official. Will be gone soon.
8163,Maybe that word doesnt mean what I think it does
8164,Literally never seen it even once
8165,"Yeah, its borderline. FB influence is slowly creeping in."
8166,I didnt realize there was one. Will do.
8167,Inconceivable! Whod say a thing like that!?
8168,Whats Facebook?
8169,"Wow, a whole week. Risky ..."
8170,Umm...yes
8171,Yes
8172,I double-dare them to come back! Bring it ...
8173,No technology is too advanced for The Boring Company!
8174,"That said, Lori deserves a lot of credit for supporting competitive, commercial space launch while under massive assault from old-school monopolists"
8175,"No real surface is perfect, but it did pull about lbs of muck rail cars out of a tunnel"
8176,"Probably mid next year before we are able to make RHD. Wish it could be sooner. Maybe try a Model S, used or new in the meantime? Used S is better than a new imo, unless you want a smaller car."
8177,Sorry
8178,"Model X pulls a lb (15,000 above US road legal limit) semi truck on a pure snow surface"
8179,Thanks!
8180,Sounds like this canton has style!
8181,Ok
8182,Youre welcome. Sorry for the delay. Only just got back from Gigafactory. Will be at our Fremont factory in the morning. Tesla team is going all out.
8183,Better to be in the Model X
8184,"The Swiss police are smart. Electricity vs diesel &amp; maintenance more than make up for purchase price diff. Plus, the bad guys will def not escape. Thats worth a lot"
8185,Maybe there should be providers for Chicago advanced transit. Monopolies are so boring ...
8186,Petra and Mars
8187,"Lori, this is ridiculous. Creating a rocket company has to be one of the dumbest and hardest ways to make money. If it was about money, Id just do another Internet company."
8188,This is completely false. Never even heard of Cortica. Just taking my kids on a Spring Break trip to see ancient historical sites in Israel &amp; Jordan.
8189,Paid respects to Masada earlier today. Live free or die.

8193,Oh you guys ...
8194,Yeah. I find it soothing.
8195,Yes
8196,Good point

8204,"Why Falcon Heavy &amp; Starman? Life cannot just be about solving one sad problem after another. There need to be things that inspire you, that make you glad to wake up in the morning and be part of humanity. That is why we did it. We did for you."
8205,Doesnt make any sense. You cant take things that fail &amp; make them work without creativity &amp; invention.
8206,"No, its not"
8207,None of the above
8208,Tunnels
8209,Because blue
8210,"I guess you could say its a mph, underground, autonomous, electric bus that automatically switches between tunnels and lifts. So, yes, a bus."
8211,"Better video coming soon, but it would look a bit like this:"
8212,"Boring Co urban loop system would have s of small stations the size of a single parking space that take you very close to your destination &amp; blend seamlessly into the fabric of a city, rather than a small number of big stations like a subway"
8213,Definitely
8214,"Will still transport cars, but only after all personalized mass transit needs are met. Its a matter of courtesy &amp; fairness. If someone cant afford a car, they should go first."
8215,Adjusting The Boring Company plan: all tunnels &amp; Hyperloop will prioritize pedestrians &amp; cyclists over cars
8216,Heavy sigh
8217,"Talulah is in England, finishing her second novel. Its about a future matriarchal society, with a twist."
8218,"Will be at SXSW Sat/Sun with Jonah &amp; Lisa, who created Westworld. Jonah made an incredible short reel of Falcon Heavy &amp; Starman. Releases tmrw aft."
8219,"To be clear, I think a fair outcome for all is quite likely. China has already shown a willingness to open their markets and I believe they will do the right thing."
8220,"We raised this with the prior administration and nothing happened. Just want a fair outcome, ideally where tariffs/rules are equally moderate. Nothing more. Hope this does not seem unreasonable."
8221,"I am against import duties in general, but the current rules make things very difficult. Its like competing in an Olympic race wearing lead shoes."
8222,"Also, no US auto company is allowed to own even % of their own factory in China, but there are five % China-owned EV auto companies in the US"
8223,"For example, an American car going to China pays % import duty, but a Chinese car coming to the US only pays %, a tenfold difference"
8224,"Do you think the US &amp; China should have equal &amp; fair rules for cars? Meaning, same import duties, ownership constraints &amp; other factors."
8225,"Every time Alexa laughs, an angel dies, so thank goodness"
8226,Depends on what you mean by doom

8231,"If there is anyone in the third row, turn off air recirculation. Third row cooling happens by air entering from the front and exiting through the vents in the rear bumper."
8232,"Very proud of the SpaceX team! Cant believe its been fifty Falcon launches already. Just ten years ago, we couldnt even reach orbit with little Falcon ."
8233,"Falcon flight launches tonight, carrying Hispasat for Spain. At metric tons and almost the size of a city bus, it will be the largest geostationary satellite weve ever flown."
8234,"Very sensible summary of supersonic flight. Obvious answer is to fly high, which gives low drag &amp; low boom amplitude at ground. If boom too loud, airframe design probably wrong too."
8235,Good points. Will add to feature list.
8236,"Yeah, that should improve soon. Software team has been buried in Model bringup and tricky bug fixes, but thats mostly done now."
8237,Almost done
8238,"Deep in the hole with my boring machine. Sometimes when we touch, the honestys too much ..."
8239,Probably about a tenth of the cost and a fifth of the time
8240,"Want to clarify that as individuals, the people responsible for the high costs &amp; long timelines are almost all well-meaning, but the system of incentives is messed up"
8241,"Higher safety &amp; environmental requirements &amp; labor costs explain only a small part of the difference. True root cause imo is an exponential growth in bureaucracy &amp; a self-serving private sector consultant industry earning a % on project cost, incenting them to maximize cost."
8242,And New York

8253,"First two Starlink demo satellites, called Tintin A &amp; B, deployed and communicating to Earth stations"
8254,"Falcon fairing half as seen from our catchers mitt in boat form, Mr. Steven. No apparent damage"
8255,About a month
8256,"This was an older version booster, so no recovery attempted"
8257,"Missed by a few hundred meters, but fairing landed intact in water. Should be able catch it with slightly bigger chutes to slow down descent."
8258,Made it back from space and fairing parafoil just deployed. Now trying to catch it ...
8259,Going to try to catch the giant fairing (nosecone) of Falcon as it falls back from space at
8260,"If you love drones above your house, youll really love vast numbers of cars flying over your head that are times bigger and noisier and blow away anything that isnt nailed down when they land"
8261,"Not sure. I let know, but its still going. I literally own zero cryptocurrency, apart from .25 BTC that a friend sent me many years ago."
8262,Thats just random
8263,"If anyone is curious, the name was inspired by The Fault in Our Stars"
8264,"High altitude wind shear data shows a probable % load exceedance. Small, but better to be paranoid. Postponing launch to tomorrow, assuming winds are better then."
8265,"Todays Falcon launch carries SpaceX test satellites for global broadband. If successful, Starlink constellation will serve least served."
8266,Strange though. Delta IV Heavy has half the payload of Falcon Heavy and the BO rocket doesnt exist yet.
8267,I dont get the little ship thing. You cant show up at Mars in something the size of a rowboat. What if there are Martians? It would be so embarrassing.
8268,Im sure its parked around here somewhere
8269,With Asimovs Foundation Series etched in glass in the glovebox. Zeroth law
8270,My new toaster
8271,Adding software feature to open glovebox automatically when car comes to a stop after a crash. Will look at bonding a thin plastic sheet to the front or back of screen.
8272,Found the source of the problem. The NASA database has the Falcon Block performance. Version currently in production and set to fly in a few months is Block . SpaceX GNC team is submitting updated numbers.
8273,Not enough ignition fluid to light the outer two engines after several three engine relights. Fix is pretty obvious.
8274,"East, to support high flight rates for F9 and dual ocean landings for FH side boosters"
8275,No
8276,A Shortfall of Gravitas
8277,A third is under construction
8278,"Under consideration. Weve already stretched the upper stage once. Easiest part of the rocket to change. Fairing , flying soon, also has a slightly larger diameter. Could make fairing much longer if need be &amp; will if BFR takes longer than expected."
8279,"Side boosters landing on droneships &amp; center expended is only ~10% performance penalty vs fully expended. Cost is only slightly higher than an expended F9, so around $95M."
8280,Of course
8281,"Maybe that plan works out, but I will seriously eat my hat with a side of mustard if that rocket flies a national security spacecraft before"
8282,"That was three years ago, before ULA cancelled all medium versions of Delta IV. Future missions have all Delta fixed costs piled on, so their cost is now $600M+ for missions contracted for launch after . Nutty high."
8283,"Both exhaust velocity (Isp) and mass ratio drive the rocket equation. Also thrust/mass matters a lot for Oberth effect. Delta upper stage Isp is good, but mass ratio and thrust are not."
8284,"The performance numbers in this database are not accurate. In process of being fixed. Even if they were, a fully expendable Falcon Heavy, which far exceeds the performance of a Delta IV Heavy, is $150M, compared to over $400M for Delta IV Heavy."
8285,Love and Rockets
8286,"Now, if I can just figure out how to attach those to a really big shark ..."
8287,Falcon Heavy engine plumes look like giant laser beams in this photo by rocketphotography
8288,Last pic of Starman in Roadster on its journey to Mars orbit and then the Asteroid Belt
8289,Third burn successful. Exceeded Mars orbit and kept going to the Asteroid Belt.
8290,Thank you on behalf of SpaceX. An exciting future lies ahead!
8291,Were doing ok for a bunch of monkeys. Humanity rocks!
8292,Thank you on behalf of SpaceX

8296,Live view of Starman
8297,"View from SpaceX Launch Control. Apparently, there is a car in orbit around Earth."
8298,"Upper stage restart nominal, apogee raised to km. Will spend hours getting zapped in Van Allen belts &amp; then attempt final burn for Mars."

8304,Live webcast of the launch at
8305,About hours to T-0 for Falcon Heavy. Watch sim for highlight reel of what we hope happens. Car actually takes months to cover M+ miles to Mars
8306,All systems remain green for launch at :30pm EST tomorrow
8307,Falcon Heavy sends a car to Mars
8308,Thanks
8309,Regular departures ...
8310,Starman in Red Roadster

8312,Falcon Heavy remains go for launch at :30pm on Tuesday
8313,Mars Awaits
8314,Pale blue dot
8315,Falcon Heavy launch simulation almost ready. Will be set to Bowies Life on Mars.
8316,Customs problem solved!
8317,Or maybe Temperature Enhancement Device
8318,"Apparently, some customs agencies are saying they wont allow shipment of anything called a Flamethrower. To solve this, we are renaming it Not a Flamethrower."
8319,"Early access build and especially Dev build are feature-rich, but the features arent reliable enough yet"
8320,Release candidate in final testing phase
8321,No
8322,I think weve figured it out
8323,Yes
8324,"Small detail, but each one will come with a serial number from to"
8325,A snowthrower would be really fun
8326,All flamethrowers will ship with a complimentary boring fire extinguisher
8327,Flamethrowers sold out
8328,Of course
8329,Yes
8330,"This rocket was meant to test very high retrothrust landing in water so it didnt hurt the droneship, but amazingly it has survived. We will try to tow it back to shore."
8331,"Woz is a lovable, fuzzy bear"
8332,From the worlds leading experts in zombie defense
8333,Now thats a real flamethrower

8337,So hard to keep future product releases secret
8338,k
8339,"For sure, and it keeps you warm at the same time"
8340,Coming soon
8341,Sure
8342,Sentience is overrated
8343,"But wait, theres more: the flamethrower is sentient, its safe word is cryptocurrency and it comes with a free blockchain"
8344,Ok
8345,Hmm ... portal gun. Now that would be interesting.
8346,Youd need millions of zombies for a so-called apocalypse anyway. Where would I even get a factory big enough to make so many!?
8347,The rumor that Im secretly creating a zombie apocalypse to generate demand for flamethrowers is completely false
8348,Good thing you didnt ask about the Freezegun ...
8349,Hmmm
8350,Unless you like fun
8351,"Obviously, a flamethrower is a super terrible idea. Definitely dont buy one."
8352,"ordered already, only left!"
8353,"When the zombie apocalypse happens, youll be glad you bought a flamethrower. Works against hordes of the undead or your money back!"
8354,Dont do this
8355,ATF says any flamethrower with a flame shorter than ft is A-ok. Our design is max fun for least danger. Id be way more scared of a steak knife.
8356,Great for roasting nuts
8357,The Boring Company flamethrower guaranteed to liven up any party!
8358,Say hello to my little friend
8359,Aiming for first flight of Falcon Heavy on Feb from Apollo launchpad A at Cape Kennedy. Easy viewing from the public causeway.
8360,Falcon Heavy hold-down firing this morning was good. Generated quite a thunderhead of steam. Launching in a week or so.
8361,Check for updates
8362,Done
8363,"Definitely. You will be able to do pretty much anything via voice command. Software team is focused on core Model functionality right now, but that will be done soon, then we will add a lot more features."
8364,There arent even good normal parties in Silicon Valley!
8365,"Actually, you can upgrade the battery pack for a huge improvement in range and some improvement in performance. There are other items you can upgrade too (seats, infotainment, etc), but I recommend keeping those parts original."
8366,That sounds cool. Will do.
8367,Fixed in next release
8368,"Long exposure of rocket ascent, reentry from space and landing burn. (Credit )"
8369,Good idea. We can just have the menu pop up as soon as you put the car into park.
8370,Of course. And an outdoor screen that plays a highlight reel of the best scenes in movie history.
8371,Near
8372,"Gonna put an old school drive-in, roller skates &amp; rock restaurant at one of the new Tesla Supercharger locations in LA"
8373,Falcon Heavy goes vertical
8374,Using a neural net to detect rain using cameras (no dedicated rain or sun sensors). Computers are very patient.
8375,Come work at the biggest &amp; most advanced factory on Earth! Located by a river near the beautiful Sierra Nevada mountains with wild horses roaming free.

8379,thanks!
8380,There and back again
8381,Thanks Jon!
8382,"satellites deployed to target orbit and Falcon has landed back at Cape Canaveral. Headed to LZ-1. Welcome back, baby!"
8383,Background on the launch
8384,Launch &amp; landing can be seen on the webcast or in person from Cape Canaveral public causeway at :33pm local tmrw
8385,Just reviewed mission params w SpaceX team. Monte Carlo runs show tmrw night has a % higher chance of a good landing. Punting hrs.
