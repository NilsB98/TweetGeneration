1,This article does not appreciate that Tesla is in California despite taxes net of rebates being higher. Incentives only a partial offset.
2,"Static fire test looks good. Pending data review, will aim to launch Sunday."
3,Rounding up to sec for a bit of timing margin. Updating flight computer command sequence
4,Aborted on ignition timing due to slow ground side valve. Adjusting ignition sequence by secs for next attempt.
5,About mins from static fire
6,holding for issue resolution
7,Abort triggered by flight computer on upper stage throttle valve. Adjusting thresholds and restarting count at T-10 mins.
8,mins from static fire test
9,"yes, from F to F"
10,It worked in Texas
11,F in this case. Deep cryo increases density and amplifies rocket performance. First time anyone has gone this low for O2.
12,Falcon is vertical on the launch pad at Cape Canaveral. Working towards static fire. Deep cryo liquid oxygen presenting some challenges.
13,Not really my letter (no authorship contribution). Just agreed to add my name when they asked.
14,Vance article on self-driving cars was inaccurate
15,Announcing formation of
16,Aiming for Falcon rocket static fire at Cape Canaveral on the th and launch about three days later
17,Agreed. Working on it.
18,wow
19,Best of luck to the Cygnus launch
20,Nice ride! Looking forward to seeing you tomorrow.
21,Good summary of my talk in Paris on climate change
22,About to give a talk at the Sorbonne
23,"Yep, good points. I hope you get back into space some day!"
24,But credit for st reusable suborbital rocket goes to X-15 And Burt Rutan for commercial
25,Jeff maybe unaware SpaceX suborbital VTOL flight began . Orbital water landing . Orbital land landing next.
26,"Not quite ""rarest"". SpaceX Grasshopper rocket did suborbital flights years ago &amp; is still around."
27,The F9 booster can reach low orbit as a single stage if not carrying the upper stage and a heavy satellite.
28,"Getting to space needs ~Mach , but GTO orbit requires ~Mach . The energy needed is the square, i.e. units for space and for orbit."
29,"It is, however, important to clear up the difference between ""space"" and ""orbit"", as described well by"
30,Congrats to Jeff Bezos and the BO team for achieving VTOL on their booster
31,"Sounds perfect, you had me at ""enterprise""."
32,Yeah and hell yeah
33,From anywhere
34,Should mention that I will be interviewing people personally and Autopilot reports directly to me. This is a super high priority.
35,We are looking for hardcore software engineers. No prior experience with cars required. Please include code sample or link to your work.
36,"Ramping up the Autopilot software team at Tesla to achieve generalized full autonomy. If interested, contact autopilot.com."
37,definitely aliens!
38,Current production is LTE. Can be upgraded by service.
39,well done!

45,I should clarify that is an independent website. We don't have any control over the content.
46,Cool!
47,"Hopefully, mid to late next year. We are being more cautious abt expanding countries to ensure a great user experience each time."
48,"Given high local demand, a Gigafactory in India would probably make sense in the long term."
49,"Yes, establishing charging and service infrastructure in Mexico now. Official launch in next several months."
50,Auto import duties are prohibitively high. Hoping for a special category for EVs. Most of our discussion was about batteries.
51,We just finished building a huge expansion in Tilburg!
52,"These are all things I've said before and are naturally needed to improve in-market affordability, so no real news here."
53,Model is due in ~2 yrs. A China factory for local demand cd be as soon as a year after. A factory in Europe wd happen for same reason.
54,My comments in China weren't transcribed correctly. Tesla will keep making cars &amp; batteries in CA &amp; NV as far into future as I can imagine.
55,"important to set AC to not recirc (air exits thru rear) and use the snap in shade, which Tesla service can provide"
56,Amount of change needed is enormous - like a spinal cord transplant. Would cost less and work better with a new car.
57,"Autopilot coming soon: curve speed adaption, controller smoothness, better lane holding on poor roads, improved fleet learning!"
58,"Regulatory approvals received, so Autopilot rolling out to all countries! (Excluding Japan, which is still under review)"
59,all

2400,Important to note that this happened during a routine filling operation. Engines were not on and there was no apparent heat source.
2401,Still working on the Falcon fireball investigation. Turning out to be the most difficult and complex failure we have ever had in years.

2602,Trippy
2603,I love Douglas Adams! My favorite spaceship ever is in HHGTTG.
2604,Exactly
2605,Good article from explaining how little incentives have actually contributed to Tesla funding
2606,how did you know?
2607,Creating a neural lace is the thing that really matters for humanity to achieve symbiosis with machines
2608,exactly
2609,It is simulations all the way down
2610,"At this point, I'm really running out of crazy things to say. Any suggestions?"
2611,control of super powerful AI by a small number of humans is the most proximate concern
2612,Just heard that Norway will ban new sales of fuel cars in . What an amazingly awesome country. You guys rock!!
2613,"Yay, baby made it home!"
2614,autosteering chutes will be added soon
2615,Recode interview with and via
2616,Supercharger policy explained well by : Will post detailed description soon. I think it's a good balance.
2617,Good summary of Tesla annual meeting by
2618,Sorry to hear that. Will take care of this &amp; investigate to see if issues you encountered are systemic.
2619,So it was good for you too ...
2620,Fast replay of today's rocket landing on SpaceX droneship OCISLY
2621,"Very similar. The crush core in the Falcon legs is reusable after soft landings, but needs to be replaced after hard."
2622,Crush core is aluminum honeycomb for energy absorption in the telescoping actuator. Easy to replace (if Falcon makes it back to port).
2623,"Rocket landing speed was close to design max &amp; used up contingency crush core, hence back &amp; forth motion. Prob ok, but some risk of tipping."
2624,Satellite deployed to km apogee. All looks good.
2625,mins to launch
2626,"There was a tiny glitch in the motion of an upper stage engine actuator. Probably not a flight risk, but still worth investigating."
2627,Really fun Model X review by . Best part is X racing while towing a fuel sports car
2628,"Flight is def capable of flying again, but it makes sense to apply ground delta qual to rocket w toughest entry conditions."
2629,Great image of ancient Mars
2630,"No prob. We care about doing what's fair &amp; just. Don't always get it right, but intent is always there &amp; we make amends when wrong"
2631,"Per the letter, Tesla paid $55/hr for *additional* services, so no."
2632,"Yes, but it is false of Merc News to say that Tesla took advantage of low cost labor. We paid $55/hr. That is unequivocal."
2633,"We still need to make sure that the injured person is taken care of, but less &amp; less of the Merc story appears to be true"
2634,Merc News story about Tesla using $5/hr labor seems to be missing a digit. Tesla actually paid $55/hr.
2635,"Totally agree. Am told this will be fixed by Thurs, maybe Fri."
2636,Full height of Falcon boost stage on legs is ~165 ft
2637,"Falcon Heavy side boosters can use most of the same airframe as Falcon , but center core needs to be buffed up a lot for transfer loads."
2638,Response to a Mercury News article about an injury on our premises
2639,Only heard about this today. Sounds like the wrong thing happened on many levels. Will investigate and make it right.
2640,"Better. Not there yet, but a solution is likely."
2641,yes
2642,yup
2643,"Most recent rocket took max damage, due to v high entry velocity. Will be our life leader for ground tests to confirm others are good."
2644,Three's company
2645,will do another AMA just before reflight of the rocket in a few months
2646,Dog snuggle thread on reddit. Comments get really good.
2647,Excited to announce Tesla's entry into automotive racing!
2648,tambin te amo
2649,It's probably the Ambien
2650,Definitely
2651,Ok
2652,Full credit to the team that's doing this. All happening without any help from me.
2653,coming soon
2654,Certainly agree that it is first and foremost a triumph for humanity. The cheering is in good spirit.
2655,I think so
2656,Max is just X Merlin thrust and min is ~40% of Merlin. Two outer engines shut off before the center does.
2657,I love you too!
2658,"Launch trajectory of Japanese commercial satellite JCSat-14, enroute to km above Earth"
2659,Thank goodness all are ok
2660,"Yeah, this was a three engine landing burn, so triple deceleration of last flight. That's important to minimize gravity losses."
2661,May need to increase size of rocket storage hangar
2662,Woohoo!!
2663,"Rocket reentry is a lot faster and hotter than last time, so odds of making it are maybe even, but we should learn a lot either way"
2664,"Tesla is increasing the production ramp as fast as possible, but I'd recommend ordering a Model soon if you want delivery"
2665,yes
2666,Filtering particulates from air makes a significant &amp; measurable diff to health. Wd like to credit Larry Page with turning me on to this.
2667,Bioweapon Defense Mode is real This is what happens when you turn it on:
2668,"Have been reviewing end of line production quality personally. Slowed things down temporarily, but it's for the best."
2669,Historical precedent. Mars vehicle will be metric.
2670,next month (with a lot of other good stuff)
2671,exactly
2672,"sides def, center maybe"
2673,naturally
2674,Falcon Heavy thrust will be M lbf at liftoff -- twice any rocket currently flying. It's a beast...
2675,F9 thrust at liftoff will be raised to M lbf later this year. It is capable of M lbf in flight.
2676,F9 LEO payload on capabilities page (correct figure on main page) should be kg
2677,"No cross feed. It would help performance, but is not needed for these numbers."
2678,No physical changes to the engine. This thrust increase is based on delta qual tests. It is just tougher than we thought.
2679,Max performance numbers are for expendable launches. Subtract % to % for reusable booster payload.
2680,"Basically current, but higher throttle setting. Good performance of recent launches allows us to reduce sigma reserve margin."
2681,Just posted latest max payload capabilities of Falcon and Heavy
2682,yes
2683,turns out it doesn't need securing
2684,yes
2685,"yes, several times"
2686,for sure
2687,things like this should be purged shortly
2688,+ for almost everything + for heat shields and a few other items.
2689,Zuck doesn't (yet) have a deep tech understanding of AI. I spend hours every week being educated by world's best researchers.
2690,"JCSat is pushing the envelope as a very hot and fast mission, so will land on the droneship. Next land landing in a few months."
2691,System scan detected only % of orders with same email and physical address. Those have been purged.
2692,of course
2693,Temporary spike in some areas due to X rd row seat recall. Should be sorted by June.
2694,"Duplicates will be cancelled. Max of will be delivered to any one person. Only ~5% of orders are , so speculation unlikely."
2695,Simple answer is that there just aren't many used Teslas available. Demand &gt;&gt; supply.
2696,checking into it ...
2697,will definitely do so
2698,"some places are trickier than others, but yes. That's the value of having a PICA-3 heat shield with propulsive landing."
2699,"It could land on Venus no problem, but would last maybe a few hours. Tough local environment."
2700,But wouldn't recommend transporting astronauts beyond Earth-moon region. Wouldn't be fun for longer journeys. Internal volume ~size of SUV.
2701,Dragon is designed to be able to land anywhere in the solar system. Red Dragon Mars mission is the first test flight.
2702,"A should be workable, but an S or particularly an X would be better"
2703,That article was incredibly misleading and you should know it. Wager right now that Sun has received far more than Tesla?
2704,Looks like Model X resale value is holding up well
2705,"Aiming for relaunch in to months, pending detailed examination and X refiring of a returned booster"
2706,We have amplified pre-delivery inspection to provide a stronger second layer of QA. Several parts being replaced as a result.
2707,By land and sea
2708,Will be interesting to see what the meantime to Hitler is for these bots. Only took Microsoft's Tay a day.
2709,Owner video of Autopilot steering to avoid collision with a truck
2710,Godot Full play
2711,"Have recently come to appreciate the awesome, absurdist humor of Waiting for Godot. We so often wait, without knowing why, when or where."
2712,me too!
2713,Great video history of Falcon by Kinematic
2714,needs latest update
2715,"Activate autopilot X in quick succession for psychedelic cowbell road. And, yes, we are adding more cowbell soon."
2716,"Not from us, but it's awesome"
2717,"Well, I thought TLI might be upset about using their material without permission. Apparently not"
2718,Thanks
2719,yes
2720,"Tickets to orbital hotels, the moon and Mars will be a lot less than people think."
2721,"Just wanted to write a note of appreciation for all those who have supported Tesla, SpaceX &amp; SolarCity over the years. Thank you."
2722,Thanks on behalf of an amazing team at SpaceX!
2723,Thanks!
2724,Thanks for your support! Looking forward to delivering the goods for you.
2725,"Screen cap from the stern cam of droneship ""Of Course I Still Love You"""
2726,"Reasons for ocean landing are technical, not economic. Orbit requires extreme horizontal velocity. Getting to space needs none."
2727,SolarCity panels produce enough zero carbon energy to charge entire Tesla fleet
2728,Nickel is also in nickels
2729,"Battery uses no rare Earth metals. Main ingredient is nickel, which is what's used to coat cutlery, so very non-toxic."
2730,"Over k cars or ~$14B in preorders in first week. Only % ordered max of two, suggesting low levels of speculation."
2731,the only thing beyond ludicrous is plaid
2732,"yes, will go all the way to Alaska"
2733,"Dex will do comms, but my speeches are just a conversation w the audience. No time to rehearse &amp; don't want to read from a prompter."
2734,we will
2735,Doesn't sound right. Will check into it.
2736,We are working on enlarging the opening. Aperture will be big enough for almost anything.
2737,Most telling is that the SpaceX Propulsion CTO switched from driving a Porsche Turbo S to a Model X
2738,Model X review
2739,probably unwise
2740,"won't be a hatchback, but we should be able to increase the opening width and height"
2741,yes
2742,yes
2743,yes
2744,yes
2745,sounds good
2746,"Signing off from impromptu Twitter AMA. Thanks for the suggestions. Btw, we really will have more cow bells."
2747,Coming soon for all Tesla cars. Just an OTA software update.
2748,"yes, coming this year"
2749,Air suspension dynamically adjusts ride height
2750,you can do that now with S and X. Will be same for .
2751,correct
2752,hopefully
2753,what's the link to that?
2754,"No, but we will need to build a factory in Europe to serve long-term regional demand as Fremont reaches max capacity."
2755,no problem
2756,Will cover whole country hopefully this year
2757,"yes, but production AWD will be a lot faster"
2758,less
2759,torque is shifted between front &amp; rear motors every ~.01 secs. Traction control is way better than a normal AWD. Digital vs analog.
2760,"And, of course, it will have more cowbells."
2761,"Model will be RWD, with dual motor AWD optional. Even RWD will have great traction on ice due to fast torque response of Tesla drivetrain."
2762,yes
2763,Superchargers and service centers will cover all of Italy later this year
2764,definitely
2765,should be addressed this year
2766,Only way to get enough rear passenger headroom was to move the rear roof cross-car support beam. A bike will still fit no problem.
2767,that's not the real steering system
2768,yes. Will easily fit two child seats. Three if you buy slim seats.
2769,Some tweaking underway
2770,Wait until you see the real steering controls and system for the . It feels like a spaceship.
2771,Won't happen. Reason initial cars are delivered close to factory is to have rapid turnaround on early issues.
2772,Edge and contour refinement are ongoing. Even .1mm matters.
2773,They can. Will be great for road trips and camping
2774,It will make sense after part of the Model unveil
2775,"A Model order gives you priority in your geography, so, even tho total count is high, ordering early will make a big difference locally."
2776,"In general, product comments, suggestions and criticisms are always welcome"
2777,We always try to maximize customer happiness even if that means a revenue shortfall in a quarter. Loyalty begets loyalty.
2778,There will be an optional tow hitch.
2779,Our production ramp plan should enable large numbers of non X/S customers to receive the credit.
2780,Matte black was surprisingly popular. Probably makes sense to bring it to production.
2781,"cool, thanks!"
2782,"Yes, if the trend continues, before"
2783,k Model orders by end of Sat
2784,Model design sketches
2785,"We are working on an exact date, but Tesla will be in India before production starts."
2786,They will. We spent a lot of time on those.
2787,"Roadster, S and X customers are the ones who got us here and are paying for . They deserve a lot of credit."
2788,"we will send something to everyone who ordered, but an extra gift for those who stood in some crazy long lines"
2789,"yes, within a region. Can't deliver to all regions simultaneously. Too much complexity."
2790,and a few other things
2791,"Token of appreciation for those who lined up coming via mail. Thought maybe -30 people per store would line up, not . Gifts on order."
2792,Maybe /4 to /2 of what happened. No one at Tesla thought it would be this high before part of the unveil.
2793,"Will give an update tonight for the day total, then last one on Wed for the full week. All efforts focused on accelerating the ramp."
2794,k as of am this morning
2795,thanks!
2796,Now k orders
2797,of course
2798,"Giga is designed to self-power via solar panels (primarily), wind &amp; geo, using its own batteries to store electricity at night."
2799,def on the cards for the future
2800,should be within a week or two max
2801,"Hi Alyssa, thanks for placing your faith in Tesla. I hope you have a great experience with the car."
2802,Definitely going to need to rethink production planning...
2803,"Thought it would slow way down today, but Model order count is now at k. Recommend ordering soon, as the wait time is growing rapidly."
2804,"Model orders at in hours. Selling price w avg option mix prob $42k, so ~$7.5B in a day. Future of electric cars looking bright!"
2805,Will include India-wide Supercharger network
2806,sure!
2807,Coming in the mail
2808,Hardware in all cars. Autopilot safety features standard. Convenience features optional (like S and X).
2809,Just order the SpaceX option package!
2810,"Thanks for tuning in to the Model unveil Part ! Part is super next level, but that's for later"
2811,"yes, will cover whole country"
2812,yes
2813,sure is
2814,X and S will also be available
2815,"Adding several more countries to Model order page tonight. Check for details, but will include India, Brazil, SA, SK, NZ, Sing &amp; Ireland."
2816,"Model orders, whether in store or online, are limited to two per person"
2817,Online ordering at will now open at :30pm Pacific to ensure no server overload. Presentation still at :30.
2818,From almost anywhere
2819,Coming soon!
2820,"Incredibly inspired by the interest in Model . You won't be disappointed. Also, small token of appreciation coming for those who lined up."
2821,Model unveil will be webcast live at :30pm California time at
2822,"You will see the car very clearly, but some important elements will be added and some will evolve."
2823,"Tomorrow is Part of the Model unveil. Part , which takes things to another level, will be closer to production."
2824,Model order day starting in Australia
2825,You can now buy cruise ship tickets for the Arctic passage. Seeing is believing.
2826,Great article by . Important to note max temp record. Too much attention on avg temp. Max matters most
2827,Looks like we may need to increase production plans for the Model
2828,Tesla charger map
2829,being fixed
2830,sure
2831,"Turn off recirc. Air exits thru rear vents. Snap in shade also avail from service, but I just tint the rear window."
2832,no
2833,The AEI meeting wasn't secret and I was only there for a few hours to talk about Mars and sustainable energy. Nothing to do with Trump.
2834,Congrats to DeepMind! Many experts in the field thought AI was years away from achieving this.
2835,"SpaceX &amp; Tesla comp is same or better than other companies. Big diff is that we don't outsource manufacturing, retail sales or service."
2836,"SpaceX and Tesla rated most meaningful work in high tech. Also, most stressful, but that goes with the territory."
2837,Wasn't done at my request. Good hacking is a gift.
2838,"Rocket landed hard on the droneship. Didn't expect this one to work (v hot reentry), but next flight has a good chance."
2839,Target altitude of km achieved. Thanks for riding on Falcon ! Looking forward to future missions.
2840,We spoke earlier today and he said he would investigate the situation.
2841,. SpaceX has not donated to any presidential campaign
2842,Evolution hasn't advanced much
2843,MIT Technology Review
2844,checking ...
2845,exactly
2846,Pushing launch to Friday due to extreme high altitude wind shear. Hits like a sledgehammer when going up supersonic
2847,Only heard about it today. Doesn't sound like they are in the right though in their dealings with our subcontractor.
2848,Launch aborted on low thrust alarm. Rising oxygen temps due to hold for boat and helium bubble triggered alarm.
2849,AF has placed launch on hold due to a boat entering the edge of the keep out zone. Scrambling helo to get them to move.
2850,"Great leg room for rd row, rear visibility better, easy storage of long cargo."
2851,"yes, it actually performed better than other colors on stain tests. Best not to have vented seats w kids though."
2852,"Can't emphasize enough that white is the best interior. Also, pick seats unless you really need ."
2853,"That said, the white interior is the best. Highly recommend."
2854,Heavy use of the white causes splitting. Adding backing material to strengthen. Will be upgraded at no cost.
2855,Worth reposting the Wait But Why piece on AI. We are at the beginning of exponential growth in digital intelligence.
2856,Next gen Atlas robot
2857,coming later this year
2858,"There is no way it is only %, given the staggeringly massive number of fossil subsidies that exist in every country, or as high as %."
2859,"Global economy of $100T is overwhelmingly fossil fuel based, so IMF estimate of $5T or % for carbon subsidy is def right order of magnitude"
2860,Just wanted to thank Stu G for . Know it meant a lot to you. Will take good care.
2861,Don't you already have a spaceship?
2862,Worth noting that all gasoline cars are heavily subsidized via oil company tax credits &amp; unpaid public health costs
2863,Sigh
2864,Hi
2865,"yeah, that's a great one too"
2866,Little bit
2867,"Worth watching ""Nathan for You"" on Comedy Central, particularly the ""Dumb Starbucks"" and ""Mechanic/Realtor"" episodes"
2868,My coffee tastes unusually good this morning
2869,yes
2870,Interesting to think of physics as a set of compression algorithms for the universe. That's basically what formulas are.
2871,"yes, this was done jointly with Tesla and Radio Flyer"
2872,This baby Model S really is quite fun
2873,More details on Model unveil in coming weeks. That's it for now.
2874,yes
2875,No signature series for Model . Same reservation amount for all.
2876,global
2877,Model reservations ($1000 down) will be accepted in Tesla stores on March and online April
2878,good point
2879,Should mention that Tesla Motors itself had nothing to do with the short movie. This was completely independent.
2880,Love this Tesla video made by
2881,My job moonlighting as a police officer in Brazil is no longer secret
2882,Must be a slow news day if denying service to a super rude customer gets this much attention
2883,Interesting name
2884,I didn't take anyone's car and never would. Car was actually allocated to engineering test (not by me) and inadvertently sold.
2885,"My best guess for : ~70% landing success rate (so still a few more RUDs to go), then hopefully improving to ~90% in"
2886,Thanks Jeff
2887,"Falcon lands on droneship, but the lockout collet doesn't latch on one the four legs, causing it"
2888,"Stage would reach low Earth orbit if not hefting a second stage, but payload would be greatly reduced."
2889,"Actually, didn't get environmental approval in time, but it was also good practice for missions where a ship is needed."
2890,"If speed at stage separation &gt; ~6000 km/hr. With a ship, no need to zero out lateral velocity, so can stage at up to ~9000 km/h."
2891,Ship landings are not needed for flexibility or to save fuel costs. Just not physically possible to return to launch site
2892,"As mentioned before, ship landings are needed for high velocity missions. Altitude &amp; distance don't mean much for orbit. All about speed."
2893,steel collet
2894,"Well, at least the pieces were bigger this time! Won't be last RUD, but am optimistic about upcoming ship landing."
2895,probably
2896,"However, that was not what prevented it being good. Touchdown speed was ok, but a leg lockout didn't latch, so it tipped over after landing."
2897,"Definitely harder to land on a ship. Similar to an aircraft carrier vs land: much smaller target area, that's also translating &amp; rotating."
2898,Maybe some debris ingestion. Engine data looks ok. Will borescope tonight. This is one of the outer engines.
2899,"Conducted hold-down firing of returned Falcon rocket. Data looks good overall, but engine showed thrust fluctuations."
2900,Next launch is a science mission from VAFB California on Sunday.
2901,Aiming to launch this weekend and (hopefully) land on our droneship. Ship landings needed for high velocity missions
2902,Sad to hear that David Bowie died. He was amazing.
2903,"In ~2 years, summon should work anywhere connected by land &amp; not blocked by borders, eg you're in LA and the car is in NY"
2904,"Tap your phone or key and your car will open the garage door, exit, close the door and come to you. Will do same in reverse for unsummon."
2905,First baby step in Tesla Summon capability now downloading over-the-air with V7.1
2906,"Worth reading The Machine Stops, an old story by E. M. Forster"
2907,"Falcon back in the hangar at Cape Canaveral. No damage found, ready to fire again."
2908,High res video of landing from the helo
2909,Live video from LZ-1
2910,Falcon standing on LZ-1 at Cape Canaveral
2911,thanks!
2912,There and back again
2913,Thanks Jon!
2914,"satellites deployed to target orbit and Falcon has landed back at Cape Canaveral. Headed to LZ-1. Welcome back, baby!"
2915,Background on the launch
2916,Launch &amp; landing can be seen on the webcast or in person from Cape Canaveral public causeway at :33pm local tmrw
2917,Just reviewed mission params w SpaceX team. Monte Carlo runs show tmrw night has a % higher chance of a good landing. Punting hrs.
2918,Currently looking good for a Sunday night (~8pm local) attempted orbital launch and rocket landing at Cape Canaveral
2919,Meant to reply to this article:
2920,This article does not appreciate that Tesla is in California despite taxes net of rebates being higher. Incentives only a partial offset.
2921,"Static fire test looks good. Pending data review, will aim to launch Sunday."
2922,Rounding up to sec for a bit of timing margin. Updating flight computer command sequence
2923,Aborted on ignition timing due to slow ground side valve. Adjusting ignition sequence by secs for next attempt.
2924,About mins from static fire
2925,holding for issue resolution
2926,Abort triggered by flight computer on upper stage throttle valve. Adjusting thresholds and restarting count at T-10 mins.
2927,mins from static fire test
2928,"yes, from F to F"
2929,It worked in Texas
2930,F in this case. Deep cryo increases density and amplifies rocket performance. First time anyone has gone this low for O2.
2931,Falcon is vertical on the launch pad at Cape Canaveral. Working towards static fire. Deep cryo liquid oxygen presenting some challenges.
2932,Not really my letter (no authorship contribution). Just agreed to add my name when they asked.
2933,Vance article on self-driving cars was inaccurate
2934,Announcing formation of
2935,Aiming for Falcon rocket static fire at Cape Canaveral on the th and launch about three days later
2936,Agreed. Working on it.
2937,wow
2938,Best of luck to the Cygnus launch
2939,Nice ride! Looking forward to seeing you tomorrow.
2940,Good summary of my talk in Paris on climate change
2941,About to give a talk at the Sorbonne
2942,"Yep, good points. I hope you get back into space some day!"
2943,But credit for st reusable suborbital rocket goes to X-15 And Burt Rutan for commercial
2944,Jeff maybe unaware SpaceX suborbital VTOL flight began . Orbital water landing . Orbital land landing next.
2945,"Not quite ""rarest"". SpaceX Grasshopper rocket did suborbital flights years ago &amp; is still around."
2946,The F9 booster can reach low orbit as a single stage if not carrying the upper stage and a heavy satellite.
2947,"Getting to space needs ~Mach , but GTO orbit requires ~Mach . The energy needed is the square, i.e. units for space and for orbit."
2948,"It is, however, important to clear up the difference between ""space"" and ""orbit"", as described well by"
2949,Congrats to Jeff Bezos and the BO team for achieving VTOL on their booster
2950,"Sounds perfect, you had me at ""enterprise""."
2951,Yeah and hell yeah
2952,From anywhere
2953,Should mention that I will be interviewing people personally and Autopilot reports directly to me. This is a super high priority.
2954,We are looking for hardcore software engineers. No prior experience with cars required. Please include code sample or link to your work.
2955,"Ramping up the Autopilot software team at Tesla to achieve generalized full autonomy. If interested, contact autopilot.com."
2956,definitely aliens!
2957,Current production is LTE. Can be upgraded by service.
2958,well done!
2959,noted
2960,"Wow, that's great!"
2961,Model S Ludicrous Mode achieves sec -60 mph and sec /4 mile in Motor Trend test
2962,"yes, comes with each car"
2963,"Compliment from Jeffrey is much appreciated, but the people of Tesla deserve all the credit"

4219,Youre an idiot
4220,"This depressingly misleading &amp; misanthropic article came from a very brief digression at an AI conf, not from an interview with Wired as is falsely implied. This is why I stopped following Wired long ago. There are way better tech pubs out there."

4225,Our existence cannot just be about solving one miserable problem after another. There need to be reasons to live.
4226,It is high time that humanity went beyond Earth. Should have a moon base by now and sent astronauts to Mars. The future needs to inspire.

4279,"Not saying the next gen Roadster special upgrade package *will* definitely enable it to fly short hops, but maybe Certainly possible. Just a question of safety. Rocket tech applied to a car opens up revolutionary possibilities."
4280,Should clarify that this is the base model performance. There will be a special option package that takes it to the next level.

4344,Answers: Yes. No. Doesn't matter.
4345,"There is only one config being built right now, so the only question is ""What color?"". Don't need a configurator for that."
4346,"Bear in mind that the production ramp is an exponential curve. Late Oct is possible, but not certain. Literally every day makes a big difference."
4347,"Dec will be a big month, so probably, but it is impossible to be certain right now"
4348,Yeah
4349,"I'm doing my best to recalibrate, but that is a fair criticism. However, if I wasn't inherently optimistic, I wouldn't be doing electric cars and rockets in the first place!"

4357,Not good. Sounds like some rd party installers are taking advantage of Powerwall demand &gt;&gt; supply. Taking action
4358,The internal Tesla Powerwall install team in PR is very small right now. Sending experienced installers from continental US to hire &amp; train local team as fast as possible.
4359,"Tesla always charges the same price for a Powerwall (only taxes &amp; shipping costs vary), so something is messed up here. I've asked my team to stop shipment to any installers charging excessive premiums."
4360,"Sounds good, I look forward to talking later today"
4361,"I would be happy to talk. Hopefully, Tesla can be helpful."
4362,"Hell yeah, with that crew, we will party like Escobar and Cobain wish they could've partied!!"
4363,We should definitely get a room ...

4365,I'm auditioning to be a roofing spokesmodel in the greater Reno area
4366,"The singularity for this level of the simulation is coming soon. I wonder what the levels above us look like. Good chance they are less interesting and deeper levels are better. So far, even our primitive sims are often more entertaining than reality itself."
4367,"The Tesla team has done this for many smaller islands around the world, but there is no scalability limit, so it can be done for Puerto Rico too. Such a decision would be in the hands of the PR govt, PUC, any commercial stakeholders and, most importantly, the people of PR."
4368,Final episode was disgustingly good

4393,"Don't give up if the cause is important enough, even if you believe you are walking into doom. Good friends really matter."
4394,"Absolutely. Moreover, we expect to expand the facility significantly over time."
4395,Does my hivemind count as me?
4396,Def not ok. Just sent a reminder to Tesla stores that we just want people to look forward to their next visit. That's what really matters.
4397,In discussions with national govt. Just need a temporary reprieve on local content requirements until we can build a factory in India.

4408,Astronaut spacesuit next to Crew Dragon
4409,"Fun, exciting tweets coming soon!"
4410,Sorry about that. You're right. I was depressing myself too
4411,"Govts don't need to follow normal laws. They will obtain AI developed by companies at gunpoint, if necessary."
4412,Should be low on our list of concerns for civilizational existential risk. NK has no entangling alliances that wd polarize world into war.
4413,"NK launching a nuclear missile would be suicide for their leadership, as SK, US and China wd invade and end the regime immediately"
4414,"May be initiated not by the country leaders, but one of the AI's, if it decides that a prepemptive strike is most probable path to victory"
4415,"China, Russia, soon all countries w strong computer science. Competition for AI superiority at national level most likely cause of WW3 imo."

4417,It begins ...
4418,"Putting together SpaceX rocket landing blooper reel. We messed up a lot before it finally worked, but there's some epic explosion footage"
4419,"Not a bad idea. For sure, it makes sense to test AI for safety in some kind of open world / sandbox virtual world."
4420,In about six months or so. Linked to dual motor config.
4421,We took the SpaceX/Tesla Hyperloop pusher pod for a spin by itself a few days ago to see what it
4422,Tunnels are sealed to atmospheres of water &amp; gas pressure. Just need walls around the apertures.
4423,"Not sure, but probably"
4424,Feature coming soon
4425,"They're so real. Anyone going to that much trouble must really care. I'd gladly follow their commands, but they're so friggin obtuse"
4426,That's pretty much why we did it
4427,"Worth reading Life by . AI will be the best or worst thing ever for humanity, so lets get it right."
4428,Hyperloop (near) vacuum tube runs parallel to SpaceX on Jack Northrop Blvd. It is miles long and just under ft in diameter.
4429,"To be clear, a Hyperloop passenger version wouldn't have intense light strobe effect (just for testing), nor uncomfortable acceleration"
4430,Brakes
4431,Will run the SpaceX pusher sled later this week and see what it can do
4432,"Moon base alpha (cheesy show, but I loved it) plus Mars"
4433,"Not that this is remotely equiv to man on the moon, but there is a world of difference between talking about some random idea and doing it"
4434,"Actually, no, his architecture was different. Also, thinking of going to the moon and actually going to the moon are not the same thing."
4435,Hyperloop pod run by team WARR
4436,"The AI could def find us there, but maybe it won't care"
4437,A Model S in The Boring Company tunnel being dug under Los Angeles (starting in Hawthorne)
4438,"Yes, it is"
4439,A tiny one
4440,"Btw, high accel only needed because tube is short. For passenger transport, this can be spread over + miles, so no spilt drinks."
4441,"No such thing as true vacuum, so actually yes"
4442,Call it ~800mph
4443,"Might be possible to go supersonic in our test Hyperloop tube, even though it's only miles long. Very high accel/decel needed"
4444,"Congratulations to WARR team from Tech Univ Munich for winning nd competition! Peak speed of km/h, which is over mph!!"
4445,Just arrived at the competition final. Student teams have amazing talent!
4446,I hope they and any others trying to advance transport technology succeed
4447,"Exactly. Wouldn't let anyone invest more than a token amount in early rounds of SpaceX and Tesla, as the probability of failure was &gt;90%."
4448,"Sorry! Coming next year, along with completing the Trans-Canada Highway and interconnecting US, Mexico and Central America."
4449,"Funny thing is, whenever I suggest all companies go to zero incentives, room gets very quiet. That's because others get a lot more than us."
4450,Literally zero incentive laws were put into place by my companies. Zero. Others put them in place. Happy to go to zero incentives for all.
4451,I'm not an investor. Just believe in putting money into my own companies. Don't think the OPM approach is right.
4452,"The latter. There are pretty long gaps between each team run, so livestream is not the way to go."
4453,"From last year, but still my favorite video of the Falcon rocket booster returning from space"
4454,SpaceX and The Boring Company are running the Hyperloop competition
4455,"Tesla does not really have ""TTunes"". That's a joke."

4457,Let me check on that for you. Found the answer right here:
4458,It was misinterpreted by Rolfe at WSJ as a fundraising effort. Neuralink is not seeking investors.
4459,WSJ has been laboriously negative for over a decade. I'm surprised they haven't bored their readers to death by now.
4460,Neuralink is not raising money
4461,"Max recovered booster velocity was Mach (BulgarianSat). Energy is velocity squared, so this is a bigger difference than it appears"
4462,"Max velocity: Mach Max altitude: km Highest so far, but velocity matters much more"
4463,Probably m or so
4464,Exactly. Yeah.
4465,Intentionally? Yes
4466,It is approximately the size of a carrot

4479,Yes
4480,Watching eclipse with sunglasses on through the Model S glass roof. Wow!
4481,SpaceX rocket factory as seen from space
4482,"Yeah, but not a priority right now"
4483,I'm not coming for anything. Just digging some tunnels and might draw a vacuum on some of them.
4484,"We are going to move all info and settings to the ""cloud"" (aka server) so any Tesla you drive in the world automatically adjusts to you"
4485,Pics of SpaceX spacesuit developed for NASA commercial crew program coming out next week. Undergoing ocean landing mobility/safety tests.
4486,Totally agree. This was a foolish oversight.
4487,At some point. Features are prioritized by importance * number of owners likely to benefit.
4488,Yeah. That's been on the future feature list for a while. Need to make sure rain sensor doesn't false positive or drain battery.
4489,Will prob do something like that
4490,Problem is possible impact on curbs or ground objects with the car itself or door swing arc
4491,"Will do. Also, we need to make it a lot easier to adjust the headrest."
4492,"Yeah, it should probably automatically adjust to the user config of whoever is closest to a given door when the handle is touched"
4493,Good point. We will add that to all cars in one of the upcoming software releases.
4494,I love Kermit
4495,"But you can check it out on . Btw, this isn't a video, like cliff diving or fake rocket landings, that matters if it's reversed."
4496,Wigs me out too much. Deleting ...
4497,"Yes, just that the permitting process is slow"
4498,I want one too!
4499,"Tesla Powerwalls can support houses of any size, but the cool thing is we can tow this house around with a Model X!"
4500,"The danger is def high for South Korea, due to proximity, but much less for distant targets like the US. SK anti-missile tech is excellent."
4501,"We certainly could, but, while not suggesting complacency, I'm confident that the US DoD and intelligence orgs have this covered"

4505,Biggest impediment to recognizing AI danger are those so convinced of their own intelligence they can't imagine anyone doing what they can't
4506,Would like to express our appreciation to Microsoft for use of their Azure cloud computing platform. This required massive processing power.
4507,OpenAI + Dota
4508,It is far too complex for that. Requires a team of the world's best AI researchers with massive computing resources.
4509,"Nobody likes being regulated, but everything (cars, planes, food, drugs, etc) that's a danger to the public is regulated. AI should be too."
4510,"I sure hope so, but we can't take that for granted"
4511,"If you're not concerned about AI safety, you should be. Vastly more risk than North Korea."
4512,OpenAI first ever to defeat world's best players in competitive eSports. Vastly more complex than traditional board games like chess &amp; Go.

4516,This is about as true as TIME being a paragon of great journalism. Please spend at least seconds checking your facts.
4517,Just because I have the outfit and the awesome weapons doesn't make me a ninja. That requires years of training.
4518,There are dozens of bogus or half-true anecdotes don't really matter &amp; maybe to that do. Guess I could post for those interested.
4519,"One other I'd like to correct from the biography: I never said I was a samurai. Said I was ninja. No, that's a joke. Didn't say that either."
4520,"MB was given weeks of salary &amp; stock in appreciation for her great contribution &amp; left to join a small firm, once again as a generalist"
4521,"Mary Beth was an amazing assistant for over yrs, but as company complexity grew, the role required several specialists vs one generalist"
4522,"Of all the bogus anecdotes, this one troubles me the most. Ashlee never actually ran this story by me or my assistant. It is total nonsense."
4523,"Ashlee Vance's biography is mostly correct, but also rife with errors &amp; never independently fact-checked, despite my request that he do so"
4524,Major increases in the Supercharger and Tesla urban charger network happening over the next several months

4530,"Arguments, followed, of course, by complaints"
4531,Are you complaining that we are not complaining enough?
4532,And let's not forget the forum on which we are posting I've heard - now this is just a rumor - that people say mean things on Twitter.
4533,Like I said ...
4534,It gets really dark
4535,"True, there are frequent complaint expansion packs"
4536,Except for complaining. That has remained constant throughout history at /100.
4537,Officially verified as the first production electric car to exceed km on a single charge! Congratulations Tesla Owners Italia!!
4538,I guess a proof of concept is needed
4539,Looking forward to launching astronauts to the International Space Station next year!

4552,"Maybe not medically tho. Dunno. Bad feelings correlate to bad events, so maybe real problem is getting carried away in what I sign up for."
4553,Yeah
4554,"The reality is great highs, terrible lows and unrelenting stress. Don't think people want to hear about the last two."
4555,Model uses two intersecting planes of air for vertical control &amp; lateral fins hidden within the dashboard for horizontal control
4556,Model Interior
4557,Yes
4558,Probably middle of next year. Focus now is on getting out of Model production hell. More versions = deeper in hell.
4559,Yes
4560,Sure
4561,"Watched them personally to make sure &amp; I agree with the outcome. Wouldn't have judged differently. Amazing videos all, but was best."
4562,Couldn't believe how incredibly inspiring and creative they were!!
4563,First!
4564,Second
4565,Third
4566,Project Loveday winners ...
4567,Setting up for Model handover tomorrow night ...
4568,If we're lucky
4569,"Sides run high thrust, center is lower thrust until sides separate &amp; fly back. Center then throttles up, keeps burning &amp; lands on droneship."
4570,Side booster rockets return to Cape Canaveral. Center lands on droneship.
4571,Falcon Heavy maiden launch this November
4572,Tesla team will verify
4573,Testing The Boring Company car elevator
4574,Love this Tesla P100D drag racing video
4575,Movie on the subject coming soon...
4576,"Tim's piece on AI is excellent, but we actually face a double exponential rate of improvement. AI hardware &amp; software are both exponential."
4577,I've talked to Mark about this. His understanding of the subject is limited.
4578,A book of the most beautiful classic cars given to me on my th birthday on a farm in Saskatchewan. Van Gogh's Starry Night.
4579,$US price in $AUD plus import duties and sales tax
4580,We can't have too many direct shareholders or we're required to become a public co. Will check if possible through a feeder fund though.
4581,Often comes as a surprise when people learn that % of my time is on engineering/design and just % on other stuff
4582,A m diameter vehicle fits in our existing factories ...
4583,"Yes, I postponed publishing in order to present the updated interplanetary rocket &amp; spaceship design in Adelaide. Will be on the final day."
4584,Discussing physics of tunnels with Mayor Vargas (who has a physics background). Hawthorne support for The Boring Company much appreciated.
4585,Kinda have to
4586,LA-SF-Reno/Sparks would be great. Tesla logistics costs for Sparks-Fremont (batteries &amp; motors) and Fremont-LA (finished cars) are gigantic.
4587,"Verbal approval was at Federal level. Still a lot of work before formal, written approval, but this opens door for state &amp; city discussions."
4588,Adding Boston and Providence would be the natural extension of the line
4589,"An underground Hyperloop would mean no disruption above ground and be way faster, so I think it is he right way to go"
4590,City of Chicago already approached us about doing a high speed tunnel from O'Hare to downtown. They've been great.
4591,"If you want this to happen fast, please let your local &amp; federal elected representatives know. Makes a big difference if they hear from you."
4592,"Still a lot of work needed to receive formal approval, but am optimistic that will occur rapidly"
4593,For sure. First set of tunnels are to alleviate greater LA urban congestion. Will start NY-DC in parallel. Then prob LA-SF and a TX loop.
4594,Support would be much appreciated!
4595,"City center to city center in each case, with up to a dozen or more entry/exit elevators in each city"
4596,Just received verbal govt approval for The Boring Company to build an underground NY-Phil-Balt-DC Hyperloop. NY-DC in mins.
4597,"Plan is to do powered landings on Mars for sure, but with a vastly bigger ship"
4598,y
4599,"True. Need to explain full story of Tesla. So much nonsense out there, amplified by propaganda from some in fossil fuels &amp; confused shorts."
4600,Not attacking Electrek. Just making sure people don't have the wrong impression.
4601,Not true. Email from customer.
4602,"I should clarify: Tesla stock is obviously high based on past &amp; present, but low if you believe in Tesla's future. Place bets accordingly"
4603,"Yeah, otherwise hard to find them"
4604,y
4605,"It is true, so fine by me"
4606,"Small thing (very small), but I made it this way for those who care and understand. Source and appearance are the same."
4607,It's what you don't say
4608,I do have one question. What does GoDaddy mean?
4609,Good point
4610,Fixed. Now it's good.
4611,Yes
4612,Stay tuned
4613,I told you it was verbose. Better tomorrow
4614,"Excited to announce the launch of ! It's a little verbose right now, but that will be fixed tomorrow."
4615,Just checked and yes
4616,"True. Also, Ariane primary bay can deliver slightly heavier satellites than Falcon . Falcon Heavy is needed ..."
4617,Commercially procured launches means launches that were openly competed. SpaceX is not allowed to compete for many US and non-US launches.
4618,US Senate hearing on advancing the exploration and settlement of space
4619,"We do that too, but for free"
4620,Hopefully
4621,"Other orgs shd also develop reusable orbital rockets. If an airplane co had reusable airplanes, buying single use airplanes wd seem crazy."
4622,That doesn't sound right
4623,"Worth noting that Boeing/Lockheed (""Other US"" on chart) get a billion dollar annual subsidy even if they launch nothing. SpaceX does not."
4624,Latest S and X tires have internal acoustic foam
4625,Going over the small nuances of Model production. Very important that nothing sounds tinny.
4626,Cool!
4627,"The very near future, not, like, the far away future"
4628,"You can now drive anywhere in the US (except N Alaska), most of Europe, China &amp; Japan using the Tesla Supercharger network!"
4629,Of course!
4630,"On University Ave, above the old bakery"
4631,"One of my sons is named Xavier, after Professor X!"
4632,That's probably the best use

4634,Maybe the upcoming IAC in Adelaide
4635,"It was a tough negotiation, but they seemed like good guys. I hope they kept the stock. Would be worth a lot today."
4636,"That pizza looked about as appetizing as drywall. If anything, they were doing people at the party a favor by taking it."
4637,"Wasn't wearing a suit, am def not part of a ""posse"" &amp; didn't even know Leo/Orlando were going. Just went to say hi to my friend Ken Howery."
4638,"Thanks PayPal for allowing me to buy back ! No plans right now, but it has great sentimental value to me."
4639,First Production Model
4640,"It's who is first to pay full price for the car. Hard rule. I have first Roadster and X, but not first S."
4641,"Ira Ehrenpreis had rights to st car as he was st to place a full deposit, but gave those rights to me as my th bday present. Tks Ira!"
4642,Production unit of Model is now built and going through final checkout. Pics soon.
4643,Never heard of them
4644,Stop biting my finger dammit
4645,This will be the highest power battery system in the world by a factor of . Australia rocks!!
4646,"The world's population is accelerating towards collapse, but few seem to notice or care"
4647,"Thanks ! Really proud of the rocket and SpaceX team today. Min apogee requirement was km, Falcon achieved km."
4648,SpaceX team reviewed all systems again late last night. Done our best to ensure all is good.
4649,We're going to spend the th doing a full review of rocket &amp; pad systems. Launch no earlier than th/6th. Only one chance to get it right
4650,Wanted to say thanks to all that own or ordered a Tesla. It matters to us that you took a risk on a new car company. We won't forget.
4651,Looks like we can reach Model cars per month in Dec
4652,"Handover party for first customer Model 's on the th! Production grows exponentially, so Aug should be cars and Sept above ."
4653,Model passed all regulatory requirements for production two weeks ahead of schedule. Expecting to complete SN1 on Friday
4654,Norway is awesome
4655,"Actually, China manufacturing quality is excellent. Among other things, that's where iPhones, many Android phones &amp; most laptops are made."
4656,Another SpaceX launch today if weather is good
4657,Coming later today
4658,Sorry to hear about China launch failure today. I know how painful that is to the people who designed &amp; built it.
4659,Suggestions welcome!
4660,I think Einstein said that
4661,Or does the Earth move up?
4662,This is a really great floor
4663,Just installed steel skeleton of the car/pod elevator. Should be operating next week.
4664,Across the road and below the ground
4665,Perspective
4666,"Nothing to be done, but wait. It's all right here:"
4667,News on Sunday
4668,Because it's off the wall
4669,Maybe it is time for the man cape to return
4670,Didn't read it. Might now though.
4671,Exactly
4672,Me too
4673,"Yes, but arguably that's worse"
4674,And I don't care who knows it. Our love will never die.
4675,Just try one. It's way better than you think.
4676,A floor that moves
4677,A ceiling is simply a floor from below
4678,Not as much as tunnels though
4679,They are so underappreciated
4680,They will never let you down
4681,I love floors
4682,Gary (the snail) is a speed demon. Long way to go before we beat him/her.
4683,"Thanks, but I am"
4684,No longer waiting for Godot. It has begun boring and just completed the first segment of tunnel in LA.
4685,"Good summary of rocket landing history. There were two successful water landings much earlier, but they didn't survive long."
4686,"Several tons of force on each fin at high angles of attack &amp; peak heating is the cube of speed, so a Mach reentry is X Mach . Intense."
4687,They should on high velocity missions to Geostationary Transfer Orbit
4688,Sped up version of today's rocket landing on the Droneship Just Read the Instructions (guess it
4689,More aero effectiveness to create steep spires on windward side at the grid fin intersections
4690,"Down the road, they will not even be repainted between launches. Aiming to be able to relaunch same orbital rocket booster in &lt;24 hours."
4691,Getting closer to fairing recovery and reuse. Had some problems with the steerable parachute. Should have it sorted out by end of year.
4692,New titanium grid fins worked even better than expected. Should be capable of an indefinite number of flights with no service.
4693,Still humans
4694,Significantly improves control force
4695,Launch at :25 delivering satellites for Iridium. Droneship repositioned due to extreme weather. Will be tight.
4696,"Closeup of the titanium grid fins. Not painted, as they glow red hot during a fast reentry."
4697,"We used to have a (lame) open loop hydraulic system, but that was upgraded to closed about years ago"
4698,"Not only that, it has all the wifis and G is coming soon"
4699,Rocket was suddenly slammed sideways right before landing. Heavy gust or something malfunctioned onboard. Reviewing telemetry.
4700,"True, but that's a minor factor for rockets"
4701,"No, but shielding got fragged every flight. More control authority is for Falcon Heavy, but also enables Falcon to land in heavier winds."
4702,"They will, but the hydraulic system is closed loop, so no fluid lost. They do need more power &amp; energy, but rocket has plenty of that."
4703,"Slightly heavier than shielded aluminum, but more control authority and can be reused indefinitely with no touch ups"
4704,Flying with larger &amp; significantly upgraded hypersonic grid fins. Single piece cast &amp; cut titanium. Can take reentry heat with no shielding.
4705,Sticking to
4706,"It's an aluminum honeycomb cartridge, so only a couple of hours to replace"
4707,"Rocket is extra toasty and hit the deck hard (used almost all of the emergency crush core), but otherwise good"
4708,Falcon will experience its highest ever reentry force and heat in today's launch. Good chance rocket booster doesn't make it back.
4709,"Technically, Ironyman"
4710,Thanks! Looks cool.
4711,"Damn, I forgot bacon"
4712,"In life, there are no easy choices"
4713,Do want irony on social media?
4714,Must remember that irony and social media are not friends. Keep forgetting. Dammit.
4715,Radiation
4716,Groan
4717,"But RWD with electric is really good in snow (assuming all weather or winter tires), as traction control is far more precise"
4718,Will extend
4719,Over km should be possible in a D with the right tires
4720,Will be full regen cooled all the way out to the meter (10 ft) nozzle diameter. Heat flux is nuts &amp; radiative view factor is low.
4721,"No plans to change kWh pack tech. You'll never worry about running out of range. Model pack is about cost reduction, not performance."
4722,No need to rely on scientists for global warming -- just use a thermometer
4723,Cool
4724,"That's because the accurate articles are boringly obvious, so they get no press attention"
4725,"First approximation of CO2 is production cost, factoring in energy source, so Model obv less CO2 to produce than $35k gas car by a lot"
4726,Calling this cueless would be generous. Much less energy required for lithium-ion batteries &amp; Gigafactory is powered by renewables anyway.
4727,No plans to change cell form factor for X and S
4728,"This is crazy, but Max Smart mentions Chaos towards the end. Coincidence?"
4729,There's a plot!?
4730,ujelly?
4731,"My real phone is an HTC Droid, which I ordered after seeing this ad"
4732,Nothing beats the shoe phone that is also a real shoe
4733,But then I get paid less
4734,"Backup valve shows no sign of leaking, but yeah"
4735,If schedule holds there will be two Falcon launches within hours (Cape &amp; Vandenberg) this weekend
4736,"Postponing launch to replace fairing pneumatic valve. It is dual redundant, but not worth taking a chance."
4737,"Promising conversations with regarding tunnel network that would carry cars, bikes &amp; pedestrians. Permits harder than technology."
4738,It's time they knew
4739,Tesla service rescues a kitten stuck in the bumper
4740,So soon you won't believe it
4741,Colonizing Mars (thanks Prof Hubbard for creating this from my talk). Major changes to the plan coming soon.
4742,"Hawthorne, California"
4743,Flying through the Falcon Factory
4744,"Mars V2 plan coming soon, which I think addresses the most fundamental flaw in V1: how to pay for development &amp; operation of giant rockets"
4745,Radar-only braking on HW1 is getting better with every release. We're hoping to do the demo where it brakes for a UFO in the fog soon.
4746,"$300M cost diff between SpaceX and Boeing/Lockheed exceeds avg value of satellite, so flying with SpaceX means satellite is basically free"
4747,In discussions with the government of India requesting temporary relief on import penalties/restrictions until a local factory is built
4748,US govt testing by finds Model X to be the safest SUV in history by significant margin
4749,"That would an interesting target. Would, of course, only count if capable of doing so right off the production line with street legal tires."
4750,How'd you know?
4751,"Linux kernel update was way harder than anticipated. Giant improvement, but meant way more OS overhead tuning to keep screen frame rate good"
4752,"New kernel goes out next weekend, new web browser next month. Radar-only braking is getting steadily better for both HW and ."
4753,HW2 Autopilot release should go wide next weekend with additional smoothness improvements to longitudinal control
4754,"We are developing the interplanetary rocket and spaceship to allow anyone to travel to the moon, Mars &amp; beyond, regardless of nationality"
4755,Thanks! Everything we make on the expensive cars goes into developing more affordable cars.
4756,Thanks for supporting Tesla and the EV mission before anyone had heard of us
4757,Heard about it. Our experience doing projects with big car companies was not great. They move slowly &amp; are reluctant to adopt new tech.
4758,"I've written two forward-looking master plans, but haven't told the Tesla history of how we got there. Lot of drama Prob worth doing?"
4759,Mostly right. The feasibility study Martin commissioned about the Lotus Elise was dead wrong though. Only % of parts ended up being common.
4760,"Slow at first, then very fast. Def not hover."
4761,"The faster, the better. Gravity losses."
4762,Damn Stonecutters!
4763,"Was no ""company"", just a (wrong) biz plan to commercialize ACP's Tzero car. No tech or IP, no employees &amp; didn't even own Tesla Motors name."
4764,"Disruption certainly. Deep AI is the real risk, though, not automation."
4765,Exactly
4766,Congrats Robb!
4767,So crazy that people were arrested for trying to keep their cars from being destroyed
4768,You may have Heard of the person who put it together
4769,"Worth watching ""Who Killed the Electric Car?"" By . Truth is indeed stranger than fiction"
4770,"If Zedd is kind enough to send me a list, it's on"
4771,"All Superchargers are being converted to solar/battery power. Over time, almost all will disconnect from the electricity grid."
4772,"I love Norway, which is the world leader in EV adoption! Great example for the rest of the world."
4773,"Long way to go, but we've convinced most of the auto industry to start EV programs &amp; gave them all our patents to help, so that's something"
4774,"Nothing to do w govt incentives or making money. Thought % prob of losing it all (almost did many times), but it was the only chance."
4775,"Since big car companies were killing their EV programs, the only chance was to create an EV company, even tho it was almost certain to fail"
4776,"They was done against the will of their owners, who held a candlelight vigil all night to protest the death of their cars"
4777,Few people know that we started Tesla when GM forcibly recalled all electric cars from customers in &amp; then crushed them in a junkyard
4778,That is true. Ludicrous mode is like having pure joy on tap. Nothing else (legal) will get you that.
4779,Click the left scroll wheel to pause or mute music
4780,"Good point, will add ""cancel nav"" to voice commands"
4781,Too awesome
4782,Must ipso facto half not bee
4783,"First of all, I cracked a long time ago. That's not news. Second, yes, I can see time. How did you know?"
4784,"Yeah, car should auto play when it gets an exact match, like it does for directions. Will make that change."
4785,Just confirmed the Tesla DJ station works in Canada
4786,Cool
4787,"No, it's not!"
4788,Yes
4789,Tap cancel on the screen
4790,"Just tap the voice button on the steering wheel and say ""Play Monty Python"" or ""Navigate home"" or anything. Voice commands work pretty well."
4791,"Just depends on whether you like a sedan or SUV. Sedan goes faster, SUV has more room."
4792,"Yeah, coming back"
4793,Coming soon!
4794,Partly
4795,Possibly my favorite skit
4796,Might work in Canada too
4797,I mean also
4798,Not yet
4799,Yeah
4800,"In the US, you can ask your Tesla to play any Monty Python (or other comedy) skit. Doesn't work outside US yet."
4801,"It's on the car. Might add it to the Tesla app at some point, so you get it on your phone if you have a Powerwall or Tesla solar."
4802,My favorite for sure
4803,Try the new Tesla DJ station on streaming radio
4804,The scene where Brian is saved from the Romans by falling off a tower into a spaceship is the best Deus Ex Machina moment of any movie ever
4805,"All Falcon Heavy cores should be at the Cape in two to three months, so launch should happen a month after that"
4806,Love Monty Python so much
4807,"Just wish they would stop sticking pins in voodoo dolls of me. That hurts, ok?"
4808,Yeah
4809,Yeah
4810,These guys want us to die so bad they can taste it
4811,Could be worse
4812,"We can either give up hope &amp; sit in traffic hell forever or try something new. The odds of success may be low, but they're better than zero."
4813,The Boring Company is in Hawthorne and has already approved the permit
4814,Thanks Such an outrageous lawsuit. People sometimes underestimate strength of US judiciary. Lot of respect for the judge &amp; jury system.
4815,Read
4816,Almost. Falcon Heavy was way harder to develop than it seemed at first.
4817,"Once you add the vintage record player, it's all good"
4818,You're welcome!
4819,"A little red wine, vintage record, some Ambien ... and magic!"
4820,A step facial treatment every morning. The mistake people make is stopping at .
4821,"And um ... not trying to brag or anything, but I think I look good for"
4822,Seems that way
4823,Of course. What base-number system were you using?
4824,That's why the pic is in black and white. Didn't have color back then.
4825,"Yeah, I counted"
4826,Tesla shareholder meeting today. Can't believe it's been years since we went public.
4827,"This is a metaphor for transparency. Also, f* underwear."
4828,Obviously
4829,"SEC disclosures, etc"
4830,"I'm not *saying* they're related, but"
4831,Or is it more about the way you use it?
4832,I hope I'm wrong
4833,"Probably closer to to imo. would be a linear extrapolation, but progress is exponential."
4834,Great comedy! They should write for .
4835,Most likely
4836,"Also, we will have a very high headcount around each Gigafactory keeping it running. They just won't be doing boring, repetitive tasks."
4837,Probably closer to four or five factories. Logistics costs mean you want to be close to the end customer.
4838,California Cabernet
4839,Wearing anything at all is just a conspiracy by the capitalist running dogs of Big Underwear
4840,He was great though
4841,Was just at the DMV &amp; dude had the actual sloth from Zootopia on his desk
4842,"Most people don't realize you can see Dragon approach the Space Station from the ground, even in LA"
4843,Proud of my Mom
4844,"Yeah, pretty much dead center. We painted the target area with radio reflective paint, which helps the radar be more precise."
4845,Exactly
4846,It's starting to feel kinda normal to reuse rockets. Good. That's how it is for cars &amp; airplanes and how it should be for rockets.
4847,First reflight of a Dragon spacecraft set for later today
4848,Good point
4849,India commits to sell only electric cars by . It is already the largest market for solar power.
4850,"Under Paris deal, China committed to produce as much clean electricity by as the US does from all sources today"
4851,Am departing presidential councils. Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world.
4852,Coming soon
4853,Yeah
4854,Will have no choice but to depart councils in that case
4855,"Don't know which way Paris will go, but I've done all I can to advise directly to POTUS, through others in WH &amp; via councils, that we remain"
4856,And then some
4857,"Yeah, it was great!"
4858,Piggyback rides around the Opera House
4859,Sydney is such a beautiful city
4860,A lot
4861,"I do via my foundation, which is now years old, but my grants are (almost always) anonymous"
4862,Yes
4863,Should finish trans-Canada this year. A stop in Swift Current for sure!
4864,Yes
4865,Comparing Model S vs Model
4866,Old-school fidget spinner back when the only things to play with were squirrels and rocks
4867,There will be a combined booster static fire. Maybe a few.
4868,"Btw, that cloud is almost entirely steam, including dark parts (like a storm). This is what the launch looks like:"
4869,"Falcon Heavy is this times three. One way or another, launch is guaranteed to be exciting ..."
4870,Will shut that down. The point is to provide something special that only existing owners can give to friends and it is limited to people.
4871,Only if you want pure joy mainlined straight into your brain
4872,You are right. Going at max speed. Not much time left.
4873,Busted
4874,Will keep the original Bond Lotus sub as-is. That design can't actually convert from car to sub. Have a new design in mind that does.
4875,True
4876,Feel exactly the same way as A.O. Scott. Particularly loved The Spy Who Loved Me
4877,All Model S and X cars will have an auto raise and lower function for the steering wheel in a few months.
4878,I spoke directly with The President three weeks ago about Paris. Many others have too. Cautiously optimistic of a positive decision.
4879,Interesting idea. Would give a dynamic deg surround view as you're driving. Have this in dev mode. Can be a bit distracting though.
4880,"Early next year. To start with, we're making the simplest Model first, like we did with S. Didn't do it with X, because I was an idiot."
4881,We could add that function pretty easily from a technical standpoint. Just need to add in the billing software.
4882,"Can be set higher than that for highways, but limited to +5mph or +8km/h off highway (true avg drive speed) for pedestrian &amp; cyclist safety"
4883,Exactly
4884,Still on for end of year. Just software limited. Any Tesla car with HW2 (all cars built since Oct last year) will be able to do this.
4885,There's just no way. Hundreds of parts and most of wiring harness would have to be replaced. Would cost more to retrofit than trading in.
4886,HW2. HW1 doesn't have enough sensors and computing power.
4887,Hopefully June for those too
4888,S for sure. It is a bigger car.
4889,"I'd highly recommend upgrading to latest Model S (which is approx version ). Only if you really want a smaller sedan, should you get a ."
4890,"Maybe I'm misinformed, but I was told that % of parts must be locally sourced and the supply doesn't yet exist in India to support that."
4891,"Yeah, control algorithm is safe, but unpleasant. New one is even safer, but super smooth."
4892,"Almost there, plus much improved web browser"
4893,That will be tied to deliveries of the first production cars in July
4894,Almost there. Probably in a few months.
4895,"You can easily turn it off in the car via settings, but that would beg the question of why you turned it off"
4896,Something cool for sure
4897,Excited about the Tesla Autopilot software release rolling out next month. New control algorithm feels as smooth as silk.
4898,"Model , Model X &amp; Model S will all have same level of Autopilot capability. It's just a matter of refining the vision &amp; control software."
4899,Wear underpants
4900,Will do

4902,Yes

4905,"Heisenberg's uncertainty principle &amp; practical limits of simultaneity in transfer make this exact thought experiment impossible, but yeah"
4906,We got stuck
4907,All the answers to questions you never asked about holes in the ground
4908,What pun?
4909,What I love about The Boring Company are the low expectations. Nowhere to go but down.

4915,And ... it's done
4916,Worked in Minecraft. Just sayin ...
4917,Of course. Why is that even a question?
4918,Imma gonna dig that tunnel with this here hammer

4927,Boring machine segments have been lowered into the starter tunnel. Going through final assembly.
4928,Cutterhead in operation at standard industry speed. Planning to jack this up by a factor of ten
4929,First tunnel for The Boring Company begins ... Full length of first tunnel will run from LAX to

4931,"Tesla needs to iterate fast on solar roof prefab/install technology, so all installs will be done by Tesla techs at first"
4932,Third one will be from Frost. Maybe the second.
4933,Yes. Good.
4934,"First machine is Godot. Still waiting ... Don't know why, when or where."
4935,Naming theme for tunnel boring machines will be poems &amp; plays. Decided against plays &amp; poems. Too obvious.
4936,That's how the tiles sit on the roof. There is no difference in strength for the Tesla tile based on orientation (not like wood).
4937,This is true. The economics are not yet compelling where housing and utility costs are low and property taxes are high.
4938,Slo-mo hail cannonball impacting Tesla solar roof tile
4939,"Will do our best. Hopefully, yes."
4940,Yes
4941,Solar roof can be ordered for almost any country. Deployment this year in the US and overseas next year.

4950,"I do love Banks, but perhaps we should reserve his names for the droneships"
4951,Simple. I like it.
4952,Kinda like Snoop Dug
4953,I don't want to be presumptuous
4954,"I know what you're thinking then why not ""the Third""? Well, I've learned my lesson about 's."
4955,"By calling it ""the Second"", it has more credibility"
4956,"Maybe Ultimate Boring Machine, the Second"
4957,Boring Not Boring
4958,Good one
4959,Been done
4960,Thinking about a name for our first tunneling machine
4961,Was just rereading one of my favorites. So beautiful
4962,"Close-up of rocket stage separation, fast flip, boostback burn in a ring of fire and then"
4963,Landing
4964,"Launch and landing of the NRO spy satellite was good. Tough call, as high altitude wind shear was at % of the theoretical load limit."
4965,"Winds aloft are unusually high (still within structural safety bounds). Worrying, but not a showstopper."
4966,"Yeah, will probably publish an update in six weeks or so"
4967,My boring TED talk
4968,Couldn't agree more
4969,Extremely
4970,Even more boring
4971,Boring

4975,Will definitely do that on my next trip
4976,"Having moo moo at Moo Moo Gold Coast with amberheard, and"
4977,That is the aspiration: to avoid AI becoming other.
4978,"Yeah, sorry I missed that. This would only work for kWh packs that are software created to , so not ."
4979,Yes
4980,Tesla will soon be offering a compelling means of upgrading a to a

4982,Pickup truck unveil in to months
4983,Next gen Roadster will be convertible
4984,Tesla Semi truck unveil set for September. Team has done an amazing job. Seriously next level.
4985,Yeah
4986,"Besides, I already said we'd add more independent members during SCTY merger. Will announce soon, but this group has nothing to do with it."
4987,This investor group should buy Ford stock. Their governance is amazing ...
4988,Autolist survey finds Tesla used car values are highest and sell fastest
4989,"Fairing is ~$5M, but that should be reusable this year. Am fairly confident we can reuse upper stage too by late next year to get to %."
4990,Latency should only be min max. Checking ...
4991,Feature coming soon that allows one touch access to all discovered Tesla Easter eggs
4992,And so the robots spared humanity ...
4993,"Exactly. Tesla is absurdly overvalued if based on the past, but that's irrelevant. A stock price represents risk-adjusted future cash flows."

5001,Technology breakthrough: turns out chemtrails are actually a message from time-traveling aliens describing the secret of teleportation
5002,"Def P100D with Ludicrous+, although the rocket starts going a lot faster after that"
5003,We can def bring it back like Dragon. Just a question of how much weight we need to add.
5004,Working on it
5005,Looks like it could do % more with some structural upgrades to handle higher loads. But that's in fully expendable mode.
5006,A lot
5007,Silliest thing we can imagine! Secret payload of st Dragon flight was a giant wheel of cheese. Inspired by a friend &amp; Monty Python.
5008,"Good point, odds go from % to &gt;0%"
5009,Falcon Heavy test flight currently scheduled for late summer
5010,"Considering trying to bring upper stage back on Falcon Heavy demo flight for full reusability. Odds of success low, but maybe worth a shot."
5011,Browser is already a little better. Kernel and browser update in prob weeks or so (lots of underlying changes) with a few nice features.
5012,Thanks Phil!
5013,Incredibly proud of the SpaceX team for achieving this milestone in space! Next goal is reflight within hours.
5014,"If you just downloaded V8.1, tap the the T on center screen three times"
5015,"On center screen. Also, center screen *will* show speed as an overlay that changes opacity according to relevance."
5016,Very few. We have yet to do a China (or Europe) launch of Model .
5017,Glad to have Tencent as an investor and advisor to Tesla
5018,No
5019,You won't care
5020,What gave me away?
5021,No
5022,Here is the latest SpaceX travel ad for the flight around the moon &amp; into deep space. Maybe needs a few edits ...
5023,"Long Neuralink piece coming out on in about a week. Difficult to dedicate the time, but existential risk is too high not to."
5024,We cannot make all country versions simultaneously or the production start would be a disaster. You would get first in Norway.
5025,Yes
5026,Yes
5027,I believe so
5028,Yup
5029,Oh so little faith
5030,The shorter wheelbase only allows for a kWh pack in Model at current cell/module energy densities
5031,Yeah
5032,Start taking orders in April
5033,"Yeah, probably a year from now. S will still win on acceleration though, due to having more space for a larger battery."
5034,"Only Model S will have the seven seater option, more cargo space, plus higher range, acceleration, two screens vs one, auto extend handles"
5035,The Model S produced today is arguably version . Let me put it this way: it is the car I will keep driving even after Model arrives.
5036,"If fate is on our side, it will be amazing. Will talk about that in detail next week."
5037,No problem
5038,"Should be summer next year. Sorry, really wish we could get RHD done sooner. We truly are working as fast as we can."
5039,Let me just go fetch my magic wand ...
5040,"First in line for dual motor as soon as we can make it, which is probably in to months."
5041,Damn straight we do! Coming with next week.
5042,First drive of a release candidate version of Model
5043,It still has one display
5044,Nothing majorly new that a consumer would notice. Lots of new tech in the design and production process though.
5045,"The more autonomous a car is, the less dash info you need. How often do you look at the instrument panel when being driven in a taxi?"
5046,How about the video we just took of the first Model release candidate drive?
5047,"Yup, machine arrives next month and we start digging the tunnel!"
5048,I think so
5049,"No, we are minimizing configuration complexity to keep the production ramp on schedule. RWD only for early production, just like Model S."
5050,Tues/Wed
5051,Because I was a dumb idiot and didn't realize at the time that it would cause confusion
5052,Tues/Wed next week
5053,"Yes. Model S will always be the fastest Tesla until next gen Roadster, which is a few years away."
5054,"Yes, but not until next year"
5055,Yes. Hardware already on all production S and X cars.
5056,"Sorta. Model is like a BMW series or Audi A4. Model S is like BMW and series, but much faster, more storage space + Autopilot"
5057,How about now?
5058,Oh Model Y is coming too in a few years. Kinda have to.
5059,All Tesla cars built since Oct last year will be capable of self-driving as software improves
5060,Definitely
5061,"Model was going to be called Model E, for obvious dumb humor reasons, but Ford sued to block it, so now it is S3X. Totally different"
5062,Yes
5063,"Model is just a smaller, more affordable version of Model S w less range &amp; power &amp; fewer features. Model S has more advanced technology."
5064,"Am noticing that many people think Model is the ""next version"" of a Tesla, like iPhone vs . This is not true."
5065,Looking forward to playing the game with my kids!
5066,"I used to be one. You're welcome. Trying my best, at least. Hope it's a bit useful."
5067,Just because I'm building a spaceship to get back to my home planet doesn't mean I'm an alien
5068,The number of extinct single planet civilizations probably exceeds live civs by at least a thousand to one. I'm being optimistic.
5069,"Probably. Either that, simulation, great filter or they are very, very subtle."
5070,I hope that didn't work
5071,~spawn npc.alien
5072,Where are the %*&gt; aliens?
5073,Looks like Tues/Wed for release
5074,Except that isn't actually my house ...
5075,"Perhaps there will be some future bill that makes a difference for Mars, but this is not it."
5076,I am not. This bill changes almost nothing about what NASA is doing. Existing programs stay in place and there is no added funding for Mars.
5077,"is a great car, but definitely Model S"
5078,Good point
5079,I wish. It's so annoying.
5080,"Finally, an explanation for daylight savings that makes sense ..."
5081,Ok
5082,"It's been a bear to get done, but prob days or so, depending on full speed autosteer test results"
5083,"Looking forward to it. I know it's cliche, but LotR is my favorite book ever Want to see the set and take my kids on tour of greater NZ."
5084,"Sure. Just check out my prior tweet on pricing ($250 kWh at pack level). Website will be updated soon, so there is complete transparency."
5085,". Can only happen with your support, and working closely with key govt and utility leaders who are strongly committed to trying new approaches"
5086,"Just wanted to write a note of appreciation to the many Australians who came out in support of the battery plan, especially"
5087,I love Wikipedia. Just gets better over time.
5088,"Answer is complex for electric motors. We use an AC induction motor fed by a DC pack thru an IGBT inverter, which kinda ""digitizes"" DC power"
5089,High voltage DC is for sure the best way to transmit electricity over long distances. Good explanation at
5090,"Ironically, direct current is the right approach today, even though alternating was right in the past. Solar power &amp; electronics both DC."
5091,You're most welcome. Very exciting to discuss the future of electricity. Renewables + storage arguably biggest disruption since DC to AC.
5092,"Just spoke with , Premier of South Australia. Very impressed. Govt is clearly committed to a smart, quick solution."
5093,"Yes, but shipping, taxes/tariffs and installation labor vary by country, as those costs are beyond our control"
5094,$250/kWh at the pack level for MWh+ systems. Tesla is moving to fixed and open pricing and terms for all products.
5095,Tesla will get the system installed and working days from contract signature or it is free. That serious enough for you?
5096,Will send you one
5097,Self-hatred
5098,Thanks JJ!
5099,Thank you for the lovely letter. That sounds like a great idea. We'll do it!
5100,SpaceX could not do this without NASA. Can't express enough appreciation.
5101,"This is not true. TM works for a lot of people and that's great, but I've maybe done it or times ever."
5102,Fly me to the moon ... Ok
5103,SpaceX announcement tomorrow at pm PST
5104,of course
5105,maybe one of those too
5106,Roller coasters are awesome
5107,Something on a tristate border might work. Gigafactory plus nearby supporting supply chain needs a very large workforce.
5108,Good chance it will
5109,Exactly
5110,I didn't pose for it (hopefully that's obvious) or want me on cover. Tunnel boring machine pic wd be way better
5111,Minor improvements update this weekend. High speed autosteer in about two weeks.
5112,Excellent Tesla Model X review
5113,Just posted a video
5114,Baby came back
5115,no
5116,System was green for launch. I called it off.
5117,"They are often right, but, in this case, we have already retired so much R&amp risk on Dragon , that I feel very confident of ."
5118,"Uses high pressure bleed off the fuel side (RP-1 kerosene) turbopump, so no dedicated pump or fluid needed"
5119,"Btw, % likely to be fine (closed loop TVC wd overcome error), but that % chance isn't worth rolling the dice. Better to wait a day."
5120,"Not obviously related to the (very tiny) helium leak, but also not out of the question"
5121,"If this is the only issue, flight would be fine, but need to make sure that it isn't symptomatic of a more significant upstream root cause"
5122,"All systems go, except the movement trace of an upper stage engine steering hydraulic piston was slightly odd. Standing down to investigate."
5123,Counting down to the first SpaceX launch from the Apollo launch pad tomorrow morning (webcast
5124,spacex's photo
5125,"Provided Dragon demo missions go well, SpaceX is highly confident of being able to fly US astronauts in"
5126,Looks like we are go for launch. Added an abort trigger at T-60 secs for pressure decay of upper stage helium spin start system.
5127,"Investigating a (very small) leak in the upper stage. If ok, will launch tomorrow."
5128,"Yes, but only deep in solid rock, where the walls are self-supporting and concrete reinforcements arguably aren't needed"
5129,It's much easier to do the CGI that way
5130,Daylight rocket launch &amp; landing at the Cape this weekend. Will be the st SpaceX flight from the Apollo launch pad.
5131,I used that one
5132,"Ok, what are some good ones? Will have to meter these out. Hopefully, kids can't die from groaning too much."
5133,They are doing India proud
5134,You may come to regret that request
5135,"Yeah, exactly. So that makes it cool, right!?"
5136,"Yeah, awesome achievement by ISRO. Very impressive!"
5137,"Apparently, there is this thing called ""Dad jokes"" and I make them"
5138,"You're right, I can't hide any more! I am Irony Man..."
5139,they were earlier drafts that I accidentally published. I said the same thing a week already.
5140,"In appreciation, Tesla is providing all repair costs free of charge and expedited."
5141,Congrats to the Tesla owner who sacrificed damage to his own car to bring a car with an unconscious driver safely to a stop!
5142,Best place to watch is on the Cape causeway
5143,Sounds like the Tesla Powerwall (consumer) and Powerpack (utility/commercial) might be useful
5144,Falcon rocket now vertical at Cape Canaveral on launch complex -A. This is the same launch
5145,Exactly. What this person said is untrue.
5146,"Please check your facts. Tesla and SpaceX joined as soon as we received the filing, which was Monday."
5147,of course it will
5148,Should all be uploaded by next month
5149,Motor Trend could only achieve sec when they tested the Porsche
5150,I don't know what make you think that's a rocket. It's completely covered in a tarpaulin...
5151,George Schultz and Jim Baker article in regarding a carbon tax
5152,yes
5153,Hoping for summer this year
5154,"yes, altitude improves performance for electric. Opposite of combustion cars."
5155,"No, will be lower. Wheelbase can't fit ."
5156,"Also, Tesla service can remove front trunk liner if you don't use it and improve performance further"
5157,"No plans to take X, S (or ) above kWh. Semi necessarily and pickup truck maybe will go above."
5158,Take out the floor mats and its . MT said everything had to be standard production.
5159,yes
5160,Production Tesla Model S P100DL sets Motor Trend all-time world record to mph in sec
5161,Signing off now. That was more than enough Twitter trouble for one morning!
5162,No rare earth metals in battery
5163,Almost ready
5164,App update is about two weeks out. Linux kernel and browser update probably a month or so. HW2 Autopilot has priority.
5165,"Yes, but Model is the overwhelming priority"
5166,I will post an article he wrote half a century ago about flying through Africa and Asia in his plane. One of my favorite things.
5167,Almost there. We are just being very careful with the rollout.
5168,A lot of terrible things could happen in four years of extremism. Do you really want another war? That's where extremism leads.
5169,"Yeah, it is hard to convey complex ideas in chars and tone is lost in text"
5170,People should push to have as many moderates advising the President as possible. Blind hate is never the right answer.
5171,Rolling out a new update today.
5172,We should try our best
5173,"Really? Ok, I will work harder on thinking first and tweeting second. Sorry for anything thoughtless."
5174,I just had three coffees
5175,Mars is critical for the long-term survival of humanity and life on Earth as we know it
5176,Numeric
5177,Gravimetric energy density of batteries and achieving a high cell mass fraction
5178,"I love Canada! I'm half Canadian. My Mom was born in Regina. My grandfather (her Dad) was American, born in Minnesota."
5179,Me too. I hope to get back to regularly scheduled programming soon ...
5180,"I agree, great country! Looking forward to taking my kids for a visit. I've heard it is incredibly beautiful."
5181,True. Me being one of them
5182,"Not perfect &amp; cd be better, but th out of + countries with only a diff to ""1st"" place means it's essentially on par"
5183,"Fair point, sorry"
5184,"Activists should be pushing for more moderates to advise President, not fewer. How could having only extremists advise him possibly be good?"
5185,Exactly
5186,Norway is great on all levels. Love Norway!
5187,Yeah. And Twitter is a hater Hellscape.
5188,"Good grief, I'm not ""working"" for Trump. I'm trying to provide advice that helps take things in a more positive direction."
5189,"Actually, I think it's kinda cool"
5190,Isn't that basically like having a jury of peers? That is a default option in the US.
5191,"Those countries have strong justice systems, but I'd put them roughly on par with US. That rating system conflates many factors."
5192,Did you read my tweets? I attacked it hard. Did not defend.
5193,You're right. Politics is a no-win situation. Somebody is going to hate what you say no matter what that is.
5194,Also good. There are several that are on par with US. Just don't think any are better. People confuse laws with courts.
5195,Mostly anti-drug laws
5196,Exactly
5197,"The laws need to change. Judges are responsible for evaluating whether an action breaks the law, not making law."
5198,The remedy for that is changing the law
5199,"Ok, but what's up the wigs?"
5200,There are many good legal systems on par with US. Just don't know any that are better.
5201,True!
5202,"Many in America don't realize how proud they should be of the legal system. Not perfect, but nowhere is the cause of justice better served."
5203,Walking down the street and saw this
5204,I wish!
5205,"Then so be it. I'd rather do what I believe is right, than do what appears right simply to avoid criticism."
5206,"Wow, cool!"
5207,That's exactly what I thought. Love Half-Life.
5208,Nuances are important
5209,ft diameter tunnel running miles under D.C.
5210,Really don't want to get in politics. I just want to help invent and develop technologies that improve lives. Feels so bizarre.
5211,"Yes, for now, but this should be addressed on all fronts: judicial, legislative and executive."
5212,"In addition, I again raised climate. I believe this is doing good, so will remain on council &amp; keep at it. Doing otherwise would be wrong."
5213,"At my request, the agenda for yesterday's White House meeting went from not mentioning the travel ban to having it be first and foremost"
5214,First I've heard of this meeting. Will find out why.
5215,maybe
5216,Video of MIT's entrant into the SpaceX Hyperloop competition. Air has been removed from the Hyperloop tube to almost vacuum conditions.
5217,Minecraft
5218,"Yes. Green cards &amp; dual citizens already ok. Work &amp; spousal visas not yet, but hopefully soon. This is separate from judicial action."
5219,There has already been and there will be progress on this matter
5220,Regarding the meeting at the White House:
5221,yes
5222,Headline &amp; article is misleading. I said it won't be retracted (ie withdrawn by Pres). It may be revoked by judicial or legislative means.
5223,"Yes, I believe that is critical to ensure a good future for humanity"
5224,Top AI researchers agree on principles for developing benefical AI
5225,"I agree with creating great jobs, restoring US strength as a great manufacturer of products and anything that makes the future exciting"
5226,"Yeah, sorry about that"
5227,"Yes, the order is still bad, but it is always important to read the source material"
5228,Reading the source material is better than reading other people's opinions about the source material
5229,Strategic &amp; Policy Forum
5230,"Exactly. There is no possibility of retraction, but there is possibility of modification. It's just a non-zero possibility. Don't know more."
5231,Please read immigration order. Lmk specific amendments. Will seek advisory council consensus &amp; present to President.
5232,It is not
5233,"Many people negatively affected by this policy are strong supporters of the US. They've done right,not wrong &amp; don't deserve to be rejected."
5234,The blanket entry ban on citizens from certain primarily Muslim countries is not the best way to address the countrys challenges
5235,"This is silly. If adding lanes actually did make it worse, that would imply removing lanes makes it better. Obv not true."
5236,And we start digging the tunnel tonight
5237,Hyperloop pod race happening this weekend at SpaceX HQ (near LAX). We built a ~mile long vacuum tube on our campus big enough to fit people.
5238,"Yeah, am hearing this from a lot of people &amp; it's getting me down. I'm just trying to make a positive contribution &amp; hope good comes of it."
5239,"Earthquakes tend to have the biggest effect on the surface, like waves on water. That's why LA can have a (lame, but getting better) subway."
5240,"Starting across from my desk at SpaceX. Crenshaw and the Freeway, which is mins from LAX"
5241,Yup
5242,Maybe next month
5243,Exciting progress on the tunnel front. Plan to start digging in a month or so.
5244,Rex Tillerson supports a carbon tax. This is what is really needed to move the needle.
5245,I'm just saying that we should see what happens first. The actions may be surprising.
5246,No they don't
5247,Was wondering what those were
5248,Sigh
5249,That may be a difficult award to decline
5250,"Tillerson also said that the risk of climate change does exist and he believed action should be taken"""
5251,"... on how to address threats of climate change. They do require a global response."""
5252,"Tillerson at his confirmation hearing: ""I think its important that the United States maintain its seat at the table in the conversation ..."
5253,"Ok, fine. Soldier . My dark secret is out ..."
5254,I share The Economist's opinion that he should be given the benefit of the doubt unless his actions prove otherwise
5255,"Rex is an exceptionally competent executive, understands geopolitics and knows how to win for his team. His team is now the USA."
5256,"This may sound surprising coming from me, but I agree with The Economist. Rex Tillerson has the potential to be an excellent Sec of State."
5257,There will be a software update this weekend that improves self-calibration ability
5258,"months maybe, months definitely"

5318,Deus ex machina on the center screen when it ends
5319,Occasional existential dread is inevitable if you think at all about the future
5320,"Yes, grid won't be needed for moderate use Superchargers in non-snowy regions"
5321,"A mere kW ... what are you referring to, a children's toy?"
5322,Brain is full right now and that's a hard one
5323,"There are some installed already, but full rollout really needs Supercharger V3 and Powerpack V2, plus SolarCity. Pieces now in place."

5470,Probably not then either
5471,Would also like to correct expectations that Tesla/SolarCity will need to raise equity or corp debt in Q4. Won't be necessary for either.
5472,"Tesla product unveiling on the th (unexpected by most), followed by Tesla/SolarCity on the th"
5473,I agree. Speed of light is a point in favor of the sim.
5474,"US automotive deaths rose % to in first half of , approx every million miles"
5475,Cumulative Tesla Autopilot miles now at million
5476,lot of circumstantial evidence for that hypothesis

5522,Tesla keeps temp below C/105F by automatically venting cabin &amp; turning on AC when needed. Can do this for up to a year on a full charge.
5523,My favorite new feature is the always-on max temp control for keeping kids and pets safe from overheating.
5524,This is a major overhaul on almost every level compared to V7.

5626,Out on LZ-1. We just completed the post-landing inspection and all systems look good. Ready to fly again.
5627,Falcon on LZ-1 at Cape Canaveral
5628,"Thanks. Exactly. Some in the press think they're so much smarter than Tesla owners that ""they know better"". Makes no sense."
5629,"V8 will be our biggest release since v1, so taking longer to refine. Awesome on every level. Meeting w design team every day."
5630,"Tesla customers are v smart &amp; don't want media speaking on their behalf abt Autopilot. Recent poll: % want it disabled -- not %, %."
5631,"It can at moderate range, but our ultrasonics are very good at human (or anything &gt;= water density) detection"
5632,Improved fan speed algorithm coming soon. Doesn't need to be so loud.
5633,Great rebuttal by a Tesla owner to those calling for Autopilot to be disabled. Was written with zero input from us.
5634,That is a very good point!
5635,Have to focus on tonight's launch. Will post Tesla (master) product plan afterwards.
5636,"Btw, want to thank both Bosch and MobilEye for their help and support in making Autopilot better. Please direct all criticism at Tesla."
5637,"Promising call today with , maker of our radar sensor. Looks like significant improvements possible via OTA software update."
5638,much appreciated
5639,Usually true. We need more sane and reasonable people making their voice heard.
5640,Sensible article on Autopilot by guardian
5641,On the other hand I do answer a toy phone like it's real
5642,large amounts of crack
5643,"hours normally, but a lot less these days"
5644,Sunday is the end of the week
5645,yes
5646,good up to ~160km/h
5647,Our radar is using a wavelength of mm. A good size for both decent resolution and rain penetration. Am hopeful...
5648,especially well
5649,Logs were downloaded for NHTSA and NTSB. Identical copies to all.
5650,"Good thing about radar is that, unlike lidar (which is visible wavelength), it can see through rain, snow, fog and dust"
5651,yes
5652,certainly moderate and maybe big advances w no incremental hardware
5653,effective stereo by comparing data at various points in time while moving
5654,elevation too
5655,only just gained access to physical vehicle
5656,AP process crash would show up in logs
5657,"Working on using existing Tesla radar by itself (decoupled from camera) w temporal smoothing to create a coarse point cloud, like lidar"
5658,"Maybe didn't realize he turned it off, but the car does issue a loud chime and a visual warning on the instrument cluster."
5659,exactly
5660,"Onboard vehicle logs show Autopilot was turned off in Pennsylvania crash. Moreover, crash would not have occurred if it was on."
5661,EU regulators find no safety concerns with Autopilot
5662,It's all fun &amp; games until ...
5663,We don't mind taking the heat for customer safety. It is the right thing to do. From
5664,can't wait to see the costume
5665,Only if I can play a monkey
5666,"Tesla finishes last in being salesy! Good. Also, I can't believe there is a real Pied Piper."
5667,Something like that
5668,already taken care of
5669,Kinda. Creating a seamlessly integrated Tesla battery &amp; solar power product that looks beautiful is the reason
5670,I like your tweets!
5671,"Tricky in chars, but: B needed for min statistical sample size. More software mods and data may be needed beyond that."
5672,Blog on Autopilot by
5673,US is ~11 deaths per billion miles. WW is deaths per billion. Autopilot already much better than either so far.
5674,Unless we get there and find it isn't enough. Just won't be before B.
5675,"It is extensively tested in the lab and in the Tesla test fleet. However, there is no substitute for real world experience."
5676,"With less than B miles, there simply isn't enough data. B is a necessary but not necessarily sufficient condition."
5677,"Thanks. Point of calling it ""beta"" was to emphasize to those who chose to use it that it wasn't perfect."
5678,exactly
5679,"that wasn't criticism, just clarification"
5680,why?
5681,thought I was posting Reuters. Copied the wrong link.
5682,Probably six months. Will include hundreds of refinements to handle rare corner cases in Autopilot.
5683,"you're right, no point"
5684,"Use of word ""beta"" is explicitly so that drivers don't get comfortable. It is not beta software in the standard sense."
5685,"Misunderstanding of what ""beta"" means to Tesla for Autopilot: any system w less than B miles of real world driving"
5686,Today is Nikola Tesla's birthday. I hope he likes what we've done in his name.
5687,"Working on Top Secret Tesla Masterplan, Part . Hoping to publish later this week."
5688,"Story was fed to LAT &amp; many other media to counter IMF $5T/year fossil subsidy study. Hey, both have a !"
5689,seriously
5690,Love reddit. Gandel gets shredded &amp; won't even answer top upvoted questions. Some really funny comments about Koch
5691,"Model S had the lowest probability of injury of any car ever tested by NHTSA, which is why ..."
5692,thanks
5693,"true, good point"
5694,"No, you were misleading mostly on your own, but w many copycats. Jalopnik just lost it's sense of irony &amp; didn't get my tweet."
5695,"cool, thanks"
5696,The Google term of self-driving would probably be more appropriate then.
5697,"In other words, the intended implication is that a driver must remain alert, just as a pilot must remain alert."
5698,"Tesla Tesla Autopilot is named after aircraft autopilot, as it is always expected that a pilot must stay alert."
5699,"All publicly known Tesla product developments are called out, incl vehicles and batteries. Would be odd *not* to include."
5700,Tesla response to the misleading Fortune articles about Autopilot
5701,Sponsored articles
5702,Because of course I hate flamingos...(maybe try eating fewer flamingo eggs in your salad)
5703,Exactly! I love Twitter.
5704,Wrong to exclude non-occupant deaths. Autopilot would have prevented this cyclist from being killed
5705,"If you care about auto deaths as material to stock prices, why no articles about M+/year deaths from other auto companies?"
5706,"Yes, it was material to you -- BS article increased your advertising revenue. Just wasn't material to TSLA, as shown by market."
5707,Radar tunes out what looks like an overhead road sign to avoid false braking events
5708,Our condolences for the tragic loss
5709,Shakespeare. Then love-devouring death do what he dare; It is enough I may but call her mine.
5710,aspirationally
5711,"My son recently asked what my favorite animal was. Well, of course"
5712,Thoughtful analysis of the Tesla/SolarCity merger by
5713,Thanks for the kind bday wishes!
5714,cute!
5715,exactly
5716,We haven't signed anything for a factory in China
5717,"Deluded, deranged, etc. Journalistic thesaurus sure got a lot of use last week ..."
5718,"Article is misleading to readers. No one is ""taking home"" anything. In a stock for stock transaction, nothing comes off the table."
5719,Of course. Our love will never die.
5720,This is going to be great
5721,Drive units and battery are sealed
5722,"If curious abt TSWLM car, am still planning to do a sports sub car that can drive on roads. Just a side project. Limited market potential"
5723,"We *def* don't recommended this, but Model S floats well enough to turn it into a boat for short periods of time. Thrust via wheel rotation."
5724,Tesla owner drives through a flooded tunnel &amp; out the other side
5725,"As mentioned at the beginning of the year, I'm expecting ~70% success rate on landings for the year. is the year of experimentation."
5726,Looks like early liquid oxygen depletion caused engine shutdown just above the deck
5727,"Turns out the landing was not as fast we thought, but still hard enough to destroy the primary airframe and accordion the engines"
5728,Thanks Tyler
5729,Landing video will be posted when we gain access to cameras on the droneship later today. Maybe hardest impact to date. Droneship still ok.
5730,Upgrades underway to enable rocket to compensate for a thrust shortfall on one of the three landing engines. Probably get there end of year.
5731,Quite rapid... Yes
5732,RUD = Rapid Unscheduled Disassembly
5733,Looks like thrust was low on of landing engines. High g landings v sensitive to all engines operating at max.
5734,"Ascent phase &amp; satellites look good, but booster rocket had a RUD on droneship"
5735,Highly recommend anything by Sean Carroll
5736,"Am concerned that advanced life may be inherently unstable. Arguably, any civ capable of extinguishing itself eventually will."
5737,"Life you can talk to is another matter, of course. Many, many orders of magnitude less likely."
5738,No way. Look at chemotrophs and extremophiles. Primitive life is bloody everywhere. Highly under the ice on Europa imo.
5739,Hence the urgency of making life as we know it multiplanetary as soon as possible
5740,"That, speed of light constraint and quantum mechanics"
5741,"And, no, I'm not an alien...but I used to be one"
5742,Latest science predicts &gt; trillion alien civilizations. Either they don't last long or there are a *lot* of aliens
5743,"Yeah, that matches what we've found so far. More likely unhinged than nefarious."
5744,Would seem to indicate that one or more people sought to create the false impression of a safety issue where none existed. Q is why?
5745,"Of greater concern: of suspension complaints to NHTSA were fraudulent, i.e. false location or vehicle identification numbers were used"
5746,NHTSA confirmed today that they found no safety concern with the Model S suspension and have no further need for data from us on this matter
5747,That is correct. It was about innovation.
5748,Nice comment about the Model S by CvK on
5749,no
5750,Something about a flying metal suit...
5751,yes
5752,S and X cells are also Panasonic
5753,Would like to clarify that Tesla is working exclusively with Panasonic for Model cells. News articles claiming otherwise are incorrect.
5754,Fourth rocket arrives in the hangar. Aiming for first reflight in Sept/Oct.
5755,"PC, of course"
5756,Highly recommend by the good people of if you like ultrafast team FPS action
5757,Trippy
5758,I love Douglas Adams! My favorite spaceship ever is in HHGTTG.
5759,Exactly
5760,Good article from explaining how little incentives have actually contributed to Tesla funding
5761,how did you know?
5762,Creating a neural lace is the thing that really matters for humanity to achieve symbiosis with machines
5763,exactly
5764,It is simulations all the way down
5765,"At this point, I'm really running out of crazy things to say. Any suggestions?"
5766,control of super powerful AI by a small number of humans is the most proximate concern
5767,Just heard that Norway will ban new sales of fuel cars in . What an amazingly awesome country. You guys rock!!
5768,"Yay, baby made it home!"
5769,autosteering chutes will be added soon
5770,Recode interview with and via
5771,Supercharger policy explained well by : Will post detailed description soon. I think it's a good balance.
5772,Good summary of Tesla annual meeting by
5773,Sorry to hear that. Will take care of this &amp; investigate to see if issues you encountered are systemic.
5774,So it was good for you too ...
5775,Fast replay of today's rocket landing on SpaceX droneship OCISLY
5776,"Very similar. The crush core in the Falcon legs is reusable after soft landings, but needs to be replaced after hard."
5777,Crush core is aluminum honeycomb for energy absorption in the telescoping actuator. Easy to replace (if Falcon makes it back to port).
5778,"Rocket landing speed was close to design max &amp; used up contingency crush core, hence back &amp; forth motion. Prob ok, but some risk of tipping."
5779,Satellite deployed to km apogee. All looks good.
5780,mins to launch
5781,"There was a tiny glitch in the motion of an upper stage engine actuator. Probably not a flight risk, but still worth investigating."
5782,Really fun Model X review by . Best part is X racing while towing a fuel sports car
5783,"Flight is def capable of flying again, but it makes sense to apply ground delta qual to rocket w toughest entry conditions."
5784,Great image of ancient Mars
5785,"No prob. We care about doing what's fair &amp; just. Don't always get it right, but intent is always there &amp; we make amends when wrong"
5786,"Per the letter, Tesla paid $55/hr for *additional* services, so no."
5787,"Yes, but it is false of Merc News to say that Tesla took advantage of low cost labor. We paid $55/hr. That is unequivocal."
5788,"We still need to make sure that the injured person is taken care of, but less &amp; less of the Merc story appears to be true"
5789,Merc News story about Tesla using $5/hr labor seems to be missing a digit. Tesla actually paid $55/hr.
5790,"Totally agree. Am told this will be fixed by Thurs, maybe Fri."
5791,Full height of Falcon boost stage on legs is ~165 ft
5792,"Falcon Heavy side boosters can use most of the same airframe as Falcon , but center core needs to be buffed up a lot for transfer loads."
5793,Response to a Mercury News article about an injury on our premises
5794,Only heard about this today. Sounds like the wrong thing happened on many levels. Will investigate and make it right.
5795,"Better. Not there yet, but a solution is likely."
5796,yes
5797,yup
5798,"Most recent rocket took max damage, due to v high entry velocity. Will be our life leader for ground tests to confirm others are good."
5799,Three's company
5800,will do another AMA just before reflight of the rocket in a few months
5801,Dog snuggle thread on reddit. Comments get really good.
5802,Excited to announce Tesla's entry into automotive racing!
5803,tambin te amo
5804,It's probably the Ambien
5805,Definitely
5806,Ok
5807,Full credit to the team that's doing this. All happening without any help from me.
5808,coming soon
5809,Certainly agree that it is first and foremost a triumph for humanity. The cheering is in good spirit.
5810,I think so
5811,Max is just X Merlin thrust and min is ~40% of Merlin. Two outer engines shut off before the center does.
5812,I love you too!
5813,"Launch trajectory of Japanese commercial satellite JCSat-14, enroute to km above Earth"
5814,Thank goodness all are ok
5815,"Yeah, this was a three engine landing burn, so triple deceleration of last flight. That's important to minimize gravity losses."
5816,May need to increase size of rocket storage hangar
5817,Woohoo!!
5818,"Rocket reentry is a lot faster and hotter than last time, so odds of making it are maybe even, but we should learn a lot either way"
5819,"Tesla is increasing the production ramp as fast as possible, but I'd recommend ordering a Model soon if you want delivery"
5820,yes
5821,Filtering particulates from air makes a significant &amp; measurable diff to health. Wd like to credit Larry Page with turning me on to this.
5822,Bioweapon Defense Mode is real This is what happens when you turn it on:
5823,"Have been reviewing end of line production quality personally. Slowed things down temporarily, but it's for the best."
5824,Historical precedent. Mars vehicle will be metric.
5825,next month (with a lot of other good stuff)
5826,exactly
5827,"sides def, center maybe"
5828,naturally
5829,Falcon Heavy thrust will be M lbf at liftoff -- twice any rocket currently flying. It's a beast...
5830,F9 thrust at liftoff will be raised to M lbf later this year. It is capable of M lbf in flight.
5831,F9 LEO payload on capabilities page (correct figure on main page) should be kg
5832,"No cross feed. It would help performance, but is not needed for these numbers."
5833,No physical changes to the engine. This thrust increase is based on delta qual tests. It is just tougher than we thought.
5834,Max performance numbers are for expendable launches. Subtract % to % for reusable booster payload.
5835,"Basically current, but higher throttle setting. Good performance of recent launches allows us to reduce sigma reserve margin."
5836,Just posted latest max payload capabilities of Falcon and Heavy
5837,yes
5838,turns out it doesn't need securing
5839,yes
5840,"yes, several times"
5841,for sure
5842,things like this should be purged shortly
5843,+ for almost everything + for heat shields and a few other items.
5844,Zuck doesn't (yet) have a deep tech understanding of AI. I spend hours every week being educated by world's best researchers.
5845,"JCSat is pushing the envelope as a very hot and fast mission, so will land on the droneship. Next land landing in a few months."
5846,System scan detected only % of orders with same email and physical address. Those have been purged.
5847,of course
5848,Temporary spike in some areas due to X rd row seat recall. Should be sorted by June.
5849,"Duplicates will be cancelled. Max of will be delivered to any one person. Only ~5% of orders are , so speculation unlikely."
5850,Simple answer is that there just aren't many used Teslas available. Demand &gt;&gt; supply.
5851,checking into it ...
5852,will definitely do so
5853,"some places are trickier than others, but yes. That's the value of having a PICA-3 heat shield with propulsive landing."
5854,"It could land on Venus no problem, but would last maybe a few hours. Tough local environment."
5855,But wouldn't recommend transporting astronauts beyond Earth-moon region. Wouldn't be fun for longer journeys. Internal volume ~size of SUV.
5856,Dragon is designed to be able to land anywhere in the solar system. Red Dragon Mars mission is the first test flight.
5857,"A should be workable, but an S or particularly an X would be better"
5858,That article was incredibly misleading and you should know it. Wager right now that Sun has received far more than Tesla?
5859,Looks like Model X resale value is holding up well
5860,"Aiming for relaunch in to months, pending detailed examination and X refiring of a returned booster"
5861,We have amplified pre-delivery inspection to provide a stronger second layer of QA. Several parts being replaced as a result.
5862,By land and sea
5863,Will be interesting to see what the meantime to Hitler is for these bots. Only took Microsoft's Tay a day.
5864,Owner video of Autopilot steering to avoid collision with a truck
5865,Godot Full play
5866,"Have recently come to appreciate the awesome, absurdist humor of Waiting for Godot. We so often wait, without knowing why, when or where."
5867,me too!
5868,Great video history of Falcon by Kinematic
5869,needs latest update
5870,"Activate autopilot X in quick succession for psychedelic cowbell road. And, yes, we are adding more cowbell soon."
5871,"Not from us, but it's awesome"
5872,"Well, I thought TLI might be upset about using their material without permission. Apparently not"
5873,Thanks
5874,yes
5875,"Tickets to orbital hotels, the moon and Mars will be a lot less than people think."
5876,"Just wanted to write a note of appreciation for all those who have supported Tesla, SpaceX &amp; SolarCity over the years. Thank you."
5877,Thanks on behalf of an amazing team at SpaceX!
5878,Thanks!
5879,Thanks for your support! Looking forward to delivering the goods for you.
5880,"Screen cap from the stern cam of droneship ""Of Course I Still Love You"""
5881,"Reasons for ocean landing are technical, not economic. Orbit requires extreme horizontal velocity. Getting to space needs none."
5882,SolarCity panels produce enough zero carbon energy to charge entire Tesla fleet
5883,Nickel is also in nickels
5884,"Battery uses no rare Earth metals. Main ingredient is nickel, which is what's used to coat cutlery, so very non-toxic."
5885,"Over k cars or ~$14B in preorders in first week. Only % ordered max of two, suggesting low levels of speculation."
5886,the only thing beyond ludicrous is plaid
5887,"yes, will go all the way to Alaska"
5888,"Dex will do comms, but my speeches are just a conversation w the audience. No time to rehearse &amp; don't want to read from a prompter."
5889,we will
5890,Doesn't sound right. Will check into it.
5891,We are working on enlarging the opening. Aperture will be big enough for almost anything.
5892,Most telling is that the SpaceX Propulsion CTO switched from driving a Porsche Turbo S to a Model X
5893,Model X review
5894,probably unwise
5895,"won't be a hatchback, but we should be able to increase the opening width and height"
5896,yes
5897,yes
5898,yes
5899,yes
5900,sounds good
5901,"Signing off from impromptu Twitter AMA. Thanks for the suggestions. Btw, we really will have more cow bells."
5902,Coming soon for all Tesla cars. Just an OTA software update.
5903,"yes, coming this year"
5904,Air suspension dynamically adjusts ride height
5905,you can do that now with S and X. Will be same for .
5906,correct
5907,hopefully
5908,what's the link to that?
5909,"No, but we will need to build a factory in Europe to serve long-term regional demand as Fremont reaches max capacity."
5910,no problem
5911,Will cover whole country hopefully this year
5912,"yes, but production AWD will be a lot faster"
5913,less
5914,torque is shifted between front &amp; rear motors every ~.01 secs. Traction control is way better than a normal AWD. Digital vs analog.
5915,"And, of course, it will have more cowbells."
5916,"Model will be RWD, with dual motor AWD optional. Even RWD will have great traction on ice due to fast torque response of Tesla drivetrain."
5917,yes
5918,Superchargers and service centers will cover all of Italy later this year
5919,definitely
5920,should be addressed this year
5921,Only way to get enough rear passenger headroom was to move the rear roof cross-car support beam. A bike will still fit no problem.
5922,that's not the real steering system
5923,yes. Will easily fit two child seats. Three if you buy slim seats.
5924,Some tweaking underway
5925,Wait until you see the real steering controls and system for the . It feels like a spaceship.
5926,Won't happen. Reason initial cars are delivered close to factory is to have rapid turnaround on early issues.
5927,Edge and contour refinement are ongoing. Even .1mm matters.
5928,They can. Will be great for road trips and camping
5929,It will make sense after part of the Model unveil
5930,"A Model order gives you priority in your geography, so, even tho total count is high, ordering early will make a big difference locally."
5931,"In general, product comments, suggestions and criticisms are always welcome"
5932,We always try to maximize customer happiness even if that means a revenue shortfall in a quarter. Loyalty begets loyalty.
5933,There will be an optional tow hitch.
5934,Our production ramp plan should enable large numbers of non X/S customers to receive the credit.
5935,Matte black was surprisingly popular. Probably makes sense to bring it to production.
5936,"cool, thanks!"
5937,"Yes, if the trend continues, before"
5938,k Model orders by end of Sat
5939,Model design sketches
5940,"We are working on an exact date, but Tesla will be in India before production starts."
5941,They will. We spent a lot of time on those.
5942,"Roadster, S and X customers are the ones who got us here and are paying for . They deserve a lot of credit."
5943,"we will send something to everyone who ordered, but an extra gift for those who stood in some crazy long lines"
5944,"yes, within a region. Can't deliver to all regions simultaneously. Too much complexity."
5945,and a few other things
5946,"Token of appreciation for those who lined up coming via mail. Thought maybe -30 people per store would line up, not . Gifts on order."
5947,Maybe /4 to /2 of what happened. No one at Tesla thought it would be this high before part of the unveil.
5948,"Will give an update tonight for the day total, then last one on Wed for the full week. All efforts focused on accelerating the ramp."
5949,k as of am this morning
5950,thanks!
5951,Now k orders
5952,of course
5953,"Giga is designed to self-power via solar panels (primarily), wind &amp; geo, using its own batteries to store electricity at night."
5954,def on the cards for the future
5955,should be within a week or two max
5956,"Hi Alyssa, thanks for placing your faith in Tesla. I hope you have a great experience with the car."
5957,Definitely going to need to rethink production planning...
5958,"Thought it would slow way down today, but Model order count is now at k. Recommend ordering soon, as the wait time is growing rapidly."
5959,"Model orders at in hours. Selling price w avg option mix prob $42k, so ~$7.5B in a day. Future of electric cars looking bright!"
5960,Will include India-wide Supercharger network
5961,sure!
5962,Coming in the mail
5963,Hardware in all cars. Autopilot safety features standard. Convenience features optional (like S and X).
5964,Just order the SpaceX option package!
5965,"Thanks for tuning in to the Model unveil Part ! Part is super next level, but that's for later"
5966,"yes, will cover whole country"
5967,yes
5968,sure is
5969,X and S will also be available
5970,"Adding several more countries to Model order page tonight. Check for details, but will include India, Brazil, SA, SK, NZ, Sing &amp; Ireland."
5971,"Model orders, whether in store or online, are limited to two per person"
5972,Online ordering at will now open at :30pm Pacific to ensure no server overload. Presentation still at :30.
5973,From almost anywhere
5974,Coming soon!
5975,"Incredibly inspired by the interest in Model . You won't be disappointed. Also, small token of appreciation coming for those who lined up."
5976,Model unveil will be webcast live at :30pm California time at
5977,"You will see the car very clearly, but some important elements will be added and some will evolve."
5978,"Tomorrow is Part of the Model unveil. Part , which takes things to another level, will be closer to production."
5979,Model order day starting in Australia
5980,You can now buy cruise ship tickets for the Arctic passage. Seeing is believing.
5981,Great article by . Important to note max temp record. Too much attention on avg temp. Max matters most
5982,Looks like we may need to increase production plans for the Model
5983,Tesla charger map
5984,being fixed
5985,sure
5986,"Turn off recirc. Air exits thru rear vents. Snap in shade also avail from service, but I just tint the rear window."
5987,no
5988,The AEI meeting wasn't secret and I was only there for a few hours to talk about Mars and sustainable energy. Nothing to do with Trump.
5989,Congrats to DeepMind! Many experts in the field thought AI was years away from achieving this.
5990,"SpaceX &amp; Tesla comp is same or better than other companies. Big diff is that we don't outsource manufacturing, retail sales or service."
5991,"SpaceX and Tesla rated most meaningful work in high tech. Also, most stressful, but that goes with the territory."
5992,Wasn't done at my request. Good hacking is a gift.
5993,"Rocket landed hard on the droneship. Didn't expect this one to work (v hot reentry), but next flight has a good chance."
5994,Target altitude of km achieved. Thanks for riding on Falcon ! Looking forward to future missions.
5995,We spoke earlier today and he said he would investigate the situation.
5996,. SpaceX has not donated to any presidential campaign
5997,Evolution hasn't advanced much

6000,exactly
6001,Pushing launch to Friday due to extreme high altitude wind shear. Hits like a sledgehammer when going up supersonic
6002,Only heard about it today. Doesn't sound like they are in the right though in their dealings with our subcontractor.
6003,Launch aborted on low thrust alarm. Rising oxygen temps due to hold for boat and helium bubble triggered alarm.
6004,AF has placed launch on hold due to a boat entering the edge of the keep out zone. Scrambling helo to get them to move.
6005,"Great leg room for rd row, rear visibility better, easy storage of long cargo."
6006,"yes, it actually performed better than other colors on stain tests. Best not to have vented seats w kids though."
6007,"Can't emphasize enough that white is the best interior. Also, pick seats unless you really need ."
6008,"That said, the white interior is the best. Highly recommend."
6009,Heavy use of the white causes splitting. Adding backing material to strengthen. Will be upgraded at no cost.
6010,Worth reposting the Wait But Why piece on AI. We are at the beginning of exponential growth in digital intelligence.
6011,Next gen Atlas robot
6012,coming later this year
6013,"There is no way it is only %, given the staggeringly massive number of fossil subsidies that exist in every country, or as high as %."
6014,"Global economy of $100T is overwhelmingly fossil fuel based, so IMF estimate of $5T or % for carbon subsidy is def right order of magnitude"
6015,Just wanted to thank Stu G for . Know it meant a lot to you. Will take good care.
6016,Don't you already have a spaceship?
6017,Worth noting that all gasoline cars are heavily subsidized via oil company tax credits &amp; unpaid public health costs
6018,Sigh
6019,Hi
6020,"yeah, that's a great one too"
6021,Little bit
6022,"Worth watching ""Nathan for You"" on Comedy Central, particularly the ""Dumb Starbucks"" and ""Mechanic/Realtor"" episodes"
6023,My coffee tastes unusually good this morning
6024,yes
6025,Interesting to think of physics as a set of compression algorithms for the universe. That's basically what formulas are.
6026,"yes, this was done jointly with Tesla and Radio Flyer"
6027,This baby Model S really is quite fun
6028,More details on Model unveil in coming weeks. That's it for now.
6029,yes
6030,No signature series for Model . Same reservation amount for all.
6031,global
6032,Model reservations ($1000 down) will be accepted in Tesla stores on March and online April
6033,good point
6034,Should mention that Tesla Motors itself had nothing to do with the short movie. This was completely independent.
6035,Love this Tesla video made by
6036,My job moonlighting as a police officer in Brazil is no longer secret
6037,Must be a slow news day if denying service to a super rude customer gets this much attention
6038,Interesting name
6039,I didn't take anyone's car and never would. Car was actually allocated to engineering test (not by me) and inadvertently sold.
6040,"My best guess for : ~70% landing success rate (so still a few more RUDs to go), then hopefully improving to ~90% in"
6041,Thanks Jeff
6042,"Falcon lands on droneship, but the lockout collet doesn't latch on one the four legs, causing it"
6043,"Stage would reach low Earth orbit if not hefting a second stage, but payload would be greatly reduced."
6044,"Actually, didn't get environmental approval in time, but it was also good practice for missions where a ship is needed."
6045,"If speed at stage separation &gt; ~6000 km/hr. With a ship, no need to zero out lateral velocity, so can stage at up to ~9000 km/h."
6046,Ship landings are not needed for flexibility or to save fuel costs. Just not physically possible to return to launch site
6047,"As mentioned before, ship landings are needed for high velocity missions. Altitude &amp; distance don't mean much for orbit. All about speed."
6048,steel collet
6049,"Well, at least the pieces were bigger this time! Won't be last RUD, but am optimistic about upcoming ship landing."
6050,probably
6051,"However, that was not what prevented it being good. Touchdown speed was ok, but a leg lockout didn't latch, so it tipped over after landing."
6052,"Definitely harder to land on a ship. Similar to an aircraft carrier vs land: much smaller target area, that's also translating &amp; rotating."
6053,Maybe some debris ingestion. Engine data looks ok. Will borescope tonight. This is one of the outer engines.
6054,"Conducted hold-down firing of returned Falcon rocket. Data looks good overall, but engine showed thrust fluctuations."
6055,Next launch is a science mission from VAFB California on Sunday.
6056,Aiming to launch this weekend and (hopefully) land on our droneship. Ship landings needed for high velocity missions
6057,Sad to hear that David Bowie died. He was amazing.
6058,"In ~2 years, summon should work anywhere connected by land &amp; not blocked by borders, eg you're in LA and the car is in NY"
6059,"Tap your phone or key and your car will open the garage door, exit, close the door and come to you. Will do same in reverse for unsummon."

6068,Thanks Jon!
6069,"satellites deployed to target orbit and Falcon has landed back at Cape Canaveral. Headed to LZ-1. Welcome back, baby!"
6070,Background on the launch
6071,Launch &amp; landing can be seen on the webcast or in person from Cape Canaveral public causeway at :33pm local tmrw
6072,Just reviewed mission params w SpaceX team. Monte Carlo runs show tmrw night has a % higher chance of a good landing. Punting hrs.
6073,Currently looking good for a Sunday night (~8pm local) attempted orbital launch and rocket landing at Cape Canaveral
6074,Meant to reply to this article:
6075,This article does not appreciate that Tesla is in California despite taxes net of rebates being higher. Incentives only a partial offset.
6076,"Static fire test looks good. Pending data review, will aim to launch Sunday."
6077,Rounding up to sec for a bit of timing margin. Updating flight computer command sequence
6078,Aborted on ignition timing due to slow ground side valve. Adjusting ignition sequence by secs for next attempt.
6079,About mins from static fire
6080,holding for issue resolution
6081,Abort triggered by flight computer on upper stage throttle valve. Adjusting thresholds and restarting count at T-10 mins.
6082,mins from static fire test
6083,"yes, from F to F"
6084,It worked in Texas
6085,F in this case. Deep cryo increases density and amplifies rocket performance. First time anyone has gone this low for O2.
6086,Falcon is vertical on the launch pad at Cape Canaveral. Working towards static fire. Deep cryo liquid oxygen presenting some challenges.
6087,Not really my letter (no authorship contribution). Just agreed to add my name when they asked.
6088,Vance article on self-driving cars was inaccurate
6089,Announcing formation of
6090,Aiming for Falcon rocket static fire at Cape Canaveral on the th and launch about three days later
6091,Agreed. Working on it.
6092,wow
6093,Best of luck to the Cygnus launch
6094,Nice ride! Looking forward to seeing you tomorrow.
6095,Good summary of my talk in Paris on climate change
6096,About to give a talk at the Sorbonne
6097,"Yep, good points. I hope you get back into space some day!"
6098,But credit for st reusable suborbital rocket goes to X-15 And Burt Rutan for commercial
6099,Jeff maybe unaware SpaceX suborbital VTOL flight began . Orbital water landing . Orbital land landing next.
6100,"Not quite ""rarest"". SpaceX Grasshopper rocket did suborbital flights years ago &amp; is still around."
6101,The F9 booster can reach low orbit as a single stage if not carrying the upper stage and a heavy satellite.
6102,"Getting to space needs ~Mach , but GTO orbit requires ~Mach . The energy needed is the square, i.e. units for space and for orbit."
6103,"It is, however, important to clear up the difference between ""space"" and ""orbit"", as described well by"
6104,Congrats to Jeff Bezos and the BO team for achieving VTOL on their booster
6105,"Sounds perfect, you had me at ""enterprise""."
6106,Yeah and hell yeah
6107,From anywhere
6108,Should mention that I will be interviewing people personally and Autopilot reports directly to me. This is a super high priority.
6109,We are looking for hardcore software engineers. No prior experience with cars required. Please include code sample or link to your work.
6110,"Ramping up the Autopilot software team at Tesla to achieve generalized full autonomy. If interested, contact autopilot.com."
6111,definitely aliens!
6112,Current production is LTE. Can be upgraded by service.
6113,well done!
6114,noted
6115,"Wow, that's great!"
6116,Model S Ludicrous Mode achieves sec -60 mph and sec /4 mile in Motor Trend test
6117,"yes, comes with each car"
6118,"Compliment from Jeffrey is much appreciated, but the people of Tesla deserve all the credit"
6119,I should clarify that is an independent website. We don't have any control over the content.
6120,Cool!
6121,"Hopefully, mid to late next year. We are being more cautious abt expanding countries to ensure a great user experience each time."
6122,"Given high local demand, a Gigafactory in India would probably make sense in the long term."
6123,"Yes, establishing charging and service infrastructure in Mexico now. Official launch in next several months."
6124,Auto import duties are prohibitively high. Hoping for a special category for EVs. Most of our discussion was about batteries.
6125,We just finished building a huge expansion in Tilburg!
6126,"These are all things I've said before and are naturally needed to improve in-market affordability, so no real news here."
6127,Model is due in ~2 yrs. A China factory for local demand cd be as soon as a year after. A factory in Europe wd happen for same reason.
6128,My comments in China weren't transcribed correctly. Tesla will keep making cars &amp; batteries in CA &amp; NV as far into future as I can imagine.
6129,"important to set AC to not recirc (air exits thru rear) and use the snap in shade, which Tesla service can provide"
6130,Amount of change needed is enormous - like a spinal cord transplant. Would cost less and work better with a new car.
6131,"Autopilot coming soon: curve speed adaption, controller smoothness, better lane holding on poor roads, improved fleet learning!"
6132,"Regulatory approvals received, so Autopilot rolling out to all countries! (Excluding Japan, which is still under review)"
6133,all
6134,Hoping for Friday release
6135,Good feedback. Will write up a list of software priorities in the coming weeks.
6136,What esthetic and functionality improvements would you like to see in the UI overhaul? Or new features entirely?

6727,Worth reading Merchants of Doubt. Same who tried to deny smoking deaths r denying climate change
6728,"Yeah, climate change should really be considered a centrist issue, as it affects everyone."
6729,"Am not suggesting shutting down CO2 production, but rather to price in environmental cost &amp; shift to sustainable energy"
6730,"Even if the answer is only on the order of %, we should still take immediate action, as there is only one atmosphere."
6731,Right question to ask Dyson or others: what is probability that human actions could cause catastrophic climate change?
6732,What most serious scientists have a problem with is the notion of certainty about *any* subject. That is not the point.
6733,Very few. Scientific consensus at time of Columbus was world was round
6734,"Sorry for all the heavy stuff abt climate change, but I really thought world wd take action sooner. No time for subtlety"

6748,"Yes, am arguing against subsidies and in favor of a tax on the end bad created. Market will then achieve best solution."
6749,"Trees are net consumers of CO2, so technically we would pay them money"
6750,Exactly. Seems crazy to risk the CO2 chemical experiment when we have to find another solution anyway.
6751,Big difference between taxing people and taxing purchases (ie consumption). Much better to emphasize the latter.
6752,The collective wisdom of the market is usually (not always) better than the smartest govt regulator.

6757,"Perhaps. I am in favor of fair, simple taxes that are neutral on most things, incent good &amp; disincent bad."
6758,"Great article on Tesla-dealer battle by Leilani Munter (), who lives in NC"

6762,"We created electric cars to help solve the problem, not because we thought it was easy money. Still isn't."
6763,"And, since we will run out of oil anyway, why risk the future of all life on Earth simply to delay sustainable energy?"
